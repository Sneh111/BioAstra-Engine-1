The principal animal species for physiological studies in\nthis mission was the mouse (Mus musculus). Unlike more recent\nspace experiments that used female mice, males were flown in the\nBion-M 1 mission. The challenging task of supporting mice in\nspace for this unmanned, automated, 30-day-long mission, was\nmade even more so by the requirement to house the males in\ngroups.\nRussian biomedical research in space traditionally has em-\nployed dogs, rats, monkeys, and more recently Mongolian gerbils.\nThe flight of Laika in 1957 was one of the early dog experiments\nand became world famous for demonstrating that a living\norganism can withstand rocket launch and weightlessness, thus\npaving the way for the first human spaceflight. Laika\u2019s success also\npromoted biomedical research with other non-human animals in\nspace that culminated with the Bion biosatellites program. A total\nof 212 rats and 12 monkeys were launched on 11 satellites and\nexposed in microgravity for 5.0\u201322.5 days between 1973 and\n1997. Animal experiments on the Bion missions have contributed\ncomprehensive data on adaptive responses of sensorimotor,\ncardiovascular, muscle, bone and other systems to spaceflight\nconditions and the mechanisms underlying these adaptations [1,2].\nThe use of mice for space experiments offers numerous\nadvantages. Probably the most apparent one is their small size\nand thus the possibility of utilizing more animals per flight, thus\nincreasing scientific output and the cost-efficiency ratio. Compar-\nisons of data obtained with mice, with those obtained from larger\nspecies or humans can also reveal how factors affecting adaptation\nto spaceflight conditions depend on the size of the organism. The\nmouse has become the most prevalent \u2018\u2018mammalian model\u2019\u2019 in\nbiomedical research, with a fully described genome and an\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org\n1\nAugust 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e104830\nestablished role in genetically engineered mutants. While mice are\npreferred mammalian models for molecular biology studies, their\nsmall size is a debated limitation rather than an advantage for\nphysiological studies. Miniaturization of scientific hardware has\nreduced some of the disadvantages of the species small size.\nFinally, the use of genetically controlled mice offers a means to\nreduce inter-individual variability and obtain potentially more\nconsistent results.\nDespite the advantages of the mouse as a model organism for\nspace research, their use was rather limited (apart from a number\nof experiments with mice during early space exploration in the\n1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s, which were aimed primarily at testing if living\norganisms can survive the launch or a brief exposure in\nmicrogravity) [3]. Flight experiments with mice were performed\naboard STS-90 (\u2018\u2018NeuroLab\u2019\u2019), STS-108, STS-129, STS-131\n(\u2018\u2018Mouse Immunology I\u2019\u2019), STS-133 (\u2018\u2018Mouse Immunology II\u2019\u2019),\nand STS-135 with exposure times ranging from 12 to 16 days.\nResearch programs of these flights were largely focused on studies\nof muscle, bone/tendon/cartilage, nervous, and cardiovascular\nsystems, and innate and acquired immune responses. Experiments\nwere performed with groups of 30 or fewer female C57BL/6J\nmice, which were dissected typically shortly after return [4\u20139].\nThe Mice Drawer System (MDS) experiment of the Italian\nSpace Agency is by far the longest spaceflight of mice to date [10].\nIn this mission, 6 mice were exposed for 91 days aboard the\nInternational Space Station. The advantages offered by the\npossibility of genetic manipulations with mice were utilized in this\nexperiment; three mice were transgenic with pleiotrophin overex-\npression (C57BLJ10/ PTN) and three mice were their wild-type\ncounterparts. The MDS habitats required periodic replenishment\nand servicing by by astronauts. Sadly, half of the mice died during\nthe course of this mission due to various estimated reasons.\nIn the present paper we aim to present a brief overview of the\nBion-M 1 mission scientific goals and experimental design. Of\nparticular interest we will focus on the program of mouse training\nand selection for the experiments, and some outcomes of the Bion-\nM 1 mission.\nOverview of the Bion-m 1 mission\nThe scientific program of the Bion-M 1 project was aimed at\nobtaining data on mechanisms of adaptation of muscle, bone,\ncardiovascular, sensorimotor and nervous systems to prolonged\nexposure in microgravity and during post-flight recovery. To this\naim, functional measurements in vivo were combined with\ncomplementary morphological, biochemical, cellular and molec-\nular studies performed in vitro. To our knowledge, Bion-M 1 is the\nfirst study with mice to follow the dynamics of re-adaptation to\nnormal gravity or to assess post-flight in vivo functions.\nThe in vivo measurements in-flight included video recording of\nmice behavior and continuous recording of arterial pressure\nduring all stages of the flight. After the flight, testing of animal\nbehavior, memory and learning, vestibular function, physical\nactivity, strength and fitness, as well as continuous registration of\ncardiovascular parameters were performed. The set of in vivo\nmeasurements was designed to provide data on the effects of\nmicrogravity on the physiological systems of interest, and to follow\nthe time course of re-adaptation to Earth\u2019s gravity after the flight.\nTo reduce the possibility of inadvertently stressing the mice with\nnumerous post-flight tests and thus obscuring the effects of\nspaceflight, the decision was made to monitor mice in their home\ncage using an automated data collection system (TSE Pheno-\nMaster) and implantable telemetry, while reducing the number of\ntests [11]. The program had to be performed with a limited\nnumber of animals; thus the use of a repeated measures design.\nMice were tested before and after the flight (or its simulation on-\nground) [12].\nThe in vitro studies were focused on metabolism and the\nstructure and function of tissues from microgravity-exposed mice.\nMore specifically, the individual studies were selected to maximize\nthe scientific yield and targeted the impact of microgravity and\nother factors specific to spaceflight on biochemical, morphological\nand, primarily, cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the\nadaptation of main physiological systems, such as the central\nnervous system, sensory systems, skeletal muscle, supporting\ntissues, including bone and connective tissues, cardiovascular,\nrespiratory, digestive, neuroendocrine and immune systems.\nThe following organs and tissues were harvested: brain\nstructures, vestibular organs, retina and crystalline lens, spinal\ncord, muscles of hind limbs and back, vertebral column, fore and\nhind paw bones, articular and cartilage structures, ligaments, bone\nmarrow, cardiac muscle, arteries from brain and hind legs, lung,\nintestines, liver, kidney, spleen, thymus, skin, salivary glands, testis\nand blood. These samples were analyzed using morphological\n(light and electron microscopy, histochemistry and immunohisto-\nchemistry), biochemical and a variety of molecular-biology\ntechniques (enzyme-linked immune assays, high-pressure liquid\nchromatography, western-blot, real-time PCR, whole-genome\ngene expression). Functional properties of skeletal muscle, cardiac\nmuscle and resistive arteries samples were evaluated using\nmyography and atomic force microscopy. Mice for in vitro studies\nwere euthanized by cervical dislocation; because of the diversity\nand number of studies, this method was chosen as the common\nprocedure to reduce variability and one that provided the least\ninterference with the objectives of the in vitro studies.\nMaterials and Methods\nEthical statement\nThe study was approved by IACUC of MSU Institute of\nMitoengineering (Protocol No\u2013 35, 1 November, 2012) and of\nBiomedical Ethics Commission of IBMP (protocol No\u2013 319, 4 April,\n2013) and conducted in compliance with the European Conven-\ntion for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experi-\nmental and Other Scientific Purposes [13].\nAnimals\nExperiments were performed with C57BL/6N male mice. The\nchoice of strain was based on the requirements of the tissue\nharvesting program participants and the fact that C57/BL6 is one\nof the most widely used strains. The selection of male mice was\nbased on the same requirement. The advantages offered by using\nmales are their substantially larger size and the absence of sex\nsteroid cycling compared to females; the vast majority of animal\nresearch is conducted using males, so their use in this study made\nthe results more readily comparable to the data in the published\nliterature. Nevertheless, the risks associated with group-housing\nmature males were recognized and greatly affected the prepara-\ntory procedures. It was decided that the optimal age of mice at\nlaunch was 4\u20135 months, when the males were still young but fully\nmature. The growth rate in mice is known to slow down by this\nage, and obesity, which C57/BL6 mice are prone to exhibit, is not\nyet considered a factor.\nSpace environment affects microorganisms by increasing their\nvirulence; major shifts in immune status in space are well\ndocumented [5,8]. It is reasonable to think that even pseudo\npathogenic species may increase morbidity during prolonged\nexposure in space [14,15]. These considerations underscored the\nnecessity for the use of specific pathogen-free mice in the\nMice in Bion-M 1 Space Mission\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org\n2\nAugust 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e104830\nexperiments, a side benefit of this approach being the reduced\nvariability of data obtained in SPF-animals [16].\nMale C57BL/6N mice (n = 300) weighing 22\u201325 g were\npurchased from the Animal Breeding Facility - Branch of\nShemyakin & Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry.\nMice were specific pathogen free. The main site for mouse training\nwas the animal facility of Moscow State University\u2019s Institute of\nMitoengineering. At the time of launch and the start of the related\ncontrol experiments, the mice were 19\u201320 weeks old.\nMice were individually identified using RFID chips (El1000,\nFelixcan, Spain) and earmarks. Routine manipulations of the mice\nconsisted of daily handling, examination, and weighing.\nExperimental groups\nThe Bion-M 1 biosatellite, launched on April 19, 2013 from\ncosmodrome Baikonur, and the descent module landed on May\n19, 2013 in the vicinity of Orenburg, successfully fulfilling the plan\nfor an unmanned, 30-day-long orbital spaceflight. Housing and\nclimate parameters were replicated in the subsequent ground\ncontrol (GC) experiment (July 26 to August 26, 2013). A total of 4\nexperimental groups were used for the flight and ground control\nexperiments (n = 45 per group). An additional fifth group included\nthe backup mice for the main flight group (n = 45). Mice of the\nspace flight group (SF) were exposed to microgravity for 30 days.\nConcurrent with the SF mice, another group of 45 mice remained\nin the animal facility (SFV). The ground control (GC) experiment\nwas conducted, after the landing, in the refurbished BOS flight\nhabitats. The habitats were installed in a climatic chamber that\nreplicated the temperature, humidity, gas composition and other\nflight-specific climate parameters. The corresponding vivarium\ncontrol (GCV) mice were housed in the animal facility. The\nseparate and concurrent GCV groups were used to account for\npossible seasonal differences between SF and GC mice.\nEach of the groups (SF, GC, SFV, GCV and backup SF mice)\nincluded mice designated for in vivo studies and recovery (n = 10)\nand mice for dissection and in vitro measurements (n = 35). Each\nin vivo study subgroup, in its turn, consisted of 5 mice implanted\nwith telemetry probes to monitor blood pressure and 5 intact\nanimals.\nMice were handled and trained before the flight and ground\ncontrol experiments. Basically, training consisted of shaping the\ngroups of three mice each for social housing and adaptation to\npaste diet. The training of mice designated for in vivo studies was\nmore comprehensive. It started with implanting the telemetry\nprobes and, following recovery, a set of preliminary behavioral\nand functional tests (Figure 1, Table 1 and 2).\nHousing\nThe BOS habitats were designed to house up to three mice per\ngroup [17]. Stable cohorts of three mice were maintained\nthroughout the training program and consequent experiments,\nwith the exception of brief periods of post-surgery recovery (5\u20136\ndays) and behavioral tests (7 days), when they were housed\nindividually.\nIndividually ventilated cages (GM 500, Techniplast, floor area\n500 cm2) were used. Techniplast mice shelters (red plastic\ntriangles, 15Lx11Wx8H cm), paper tubes and paper tissues for\nnesting material were provided to enrich the environment. Cage\ncleaning was done once weekly, and water was refreshed twice\nweekly. All materials were sterilized prior to use by autoclave.\nTechniques aimed to prevent animal contamination were thor-\noughly followed.\nHabitats\nThe hardware for mice housing in-flight was an adapted version\nof the habitats used for rats in the original Bion program. It was\ndeveloped by Biofizpribor, according to the IBMP requirements\nand was tested by IBMP in 2011. Each block consisted of five\nindividual habitats (BOS, Block Obespecheniya Soderzhaniya,\nRussian for - literally - Unit for the Provision of Housing). The\nliving compartment of each habitat was an acrylic cylinder\n9862 mm in diameter and 200610 mm in length with a total\nvolume of approximately 1.7 l (Figure 2). A stainless steel feeder\n(9 ml) was mounted at one end (the \u2018\u2018top\u2019\u2019) of the cylinder. The\nfeeder had a flap, used in the refill procedure. The food\ndistribution system (except for the feeders) was common to all\nfive habitats in the block. Paste \u2018\u2018space\u2019\u2019 food was pumped from the\ncontainer and distributed between individual habitats of the\nassembly 6 times daily (every 4 hours at 00:00, 04:00, 08:00,\n12:00, 16:00 and 20:00), a total of 54 g/day per 3 mice. Food\ndistribution was adjusted through manipulations of pressure\ndeveloped in the container and in the feeders to follow this\npattern prior to experiments.\nBulbs for day-phase (08:00\u201320:00, 4565 Lux) and night-phase\n(20:00\u201308:00, 562 Lux) lighting, an air supply fan (0.3 m/s) and\nan air distribution system were positioned on one side of the\ncylinder. A video camera was installed between the light bulbs;\nvideo was recorded 6 times daily (simultaneously with feeding,\neach session lasted 2 hours) at 8 frames per second. The opposite\nside of the cylinder had the grid for waste removal. The waste\nremoval system was individual for each habitat. The door at the\n\u2018\u2018bottom\u2019\u2019 of the cylinder had a glass window. In order to minimize\nimpact of variability arising from possible differences in mice\nhousing conditions, experimental subgroups were formed from\nmice that were housed in different habitats.\nAir composition and climate parameters in the satellite were\nmaintained by the centralized life support system and remained in\nthe designed range throughout the flight.\nDiet\nDuring the initial stage of training, mice were provided with\nstandard pelleted food (Assortiment Agro, Russia) and deionized\nwater given ad libitum. Two weeks prior to launch, and the start of\nthe GC experiment, the animals were adapted to the flight paste\nfood diet. Both the paste and standard diets (pelleted food and\nwater) were first presented together; after 2\u20133 days the water bottle\nwas removed, followed in another 2\u20133 days by the removal of the\npelleted food. Vivarium control (SFV and GCV) groups were fed\nstandard chow and water throughout the experiments. The\n\u2018\u2018space\u2019\u2019 paste food diet was developed at IBMP by T. Gurieva\nand E. Mednikova. It was produced based on the standard chow,\nwith water and casein as gelling agent added.\nConsumption of standard pelleted chow and water (in SFV and\nGCV) or paste diet (in SF and GC) was monitored daily for ten\ndays in ten randomly chosen cages per group. Data for the cage\nwas averaged across the days and expressed as g per 10 g\nbodyweight.\nA separate preliminary experiment in metabolic chambers was\nconducted to quantify urination in mice fed standard chow and\npaste food. Four groups of mice, of 3 mice each, were housed in\nmetabolic chambers (Techniplast, Italy) and fed pelleted food\n(grinded) or paste food. Body weight, food and water consumption,\nurine volume and feces weight were monitored daily (3 days for\neach diet).\nMice in Bion-M 1 Space Mission\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org\n3\nAugust 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e104830\nMice in Bion-M 1 Space Mission\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org\n4\nAugust 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e104830\nTelemetry probes implantation\nArterial\npressure\nwas\nmonitored\nin\nsub-groups\nof\nmice\ndesignated for recovery, using implantable probes and telemetry\nhardware (Data Science International, USA). The hardware was\nadapted and integrated to the Bion-M biosatellite by engineers\nfrom Biofizpribor (St. Petersburg, Russia) and the Centre national\nd\u2019e\u00b4tudes spatiales (CNES, France). Miniature probes (model PA-\nC10) weighing 1.4 g were implanted 3 weeks before the start of\nexperiments,\nfollowing\nthe\nmanufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions.\nThe\ncatheter of the probe was implanted into the left carotid so that\nits tip just reached the aorta [18]. The body of the transmitter was\nimplanted subcutaneously on the flank, briefly described below.\nMice were anaesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of a\nsolution containing tiletamine/zolazepam (15 mg/kg each) com-\nbined with xylazine (3 mg/kg). Depth of anesthesia was assessed\nregularly by hind leg pinch and observation of respiration rate,\nand maintained by additional dose(s) of the mixture (about 20% of\nthe initial dose) as needed. A midline incision was made on the\nventral neck. The carotid artery was separated and ligated 1\u2013\n2 mm cranially to its bifurcation. A second ligature was used to\nsuspend the artery 4\u20135 mm proximal to the site of ligation.\nThrough a small incision in the artery wall, the catheter was\nadvanced 6\u20137 mm towards the aorta and fixed in place with\nsutures and acrylic glue. A subcutaneous pocket on the flank of the\nanimal was made with blunt scissors, and the transmitter was\ninserted there with a small hemostat. The catheter and the\ntransmitter were fixed in place with acrylic glue and the skin\nincision closed with absorbable sutures. During the recovery\nperiod, mice were housed individually; they were under daily\nveterinarian control and received ibuprofen 4 mg/ml and Bactrim\n4 mg/ml in drinking water.\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of the experiments. Mice of SF, SFV and backup SF groups were co-adapted in housing groups of 3 mice each, SF\nmice were adapted to paste food diet, and mice of in vivo subgroups passed through preliminary tests. After transportation to and adaptation at\nBaikonur, SF mice were flown aboard the Bion-M 1 satellite for 30 days. After landing mice were examined and transported to Moscow, where animals\nof the in vitro subgroup were dissected, while recovery dynamics was followed in the in-vivo subgroup before dissection 7 days after landing. Ground\ncontrol experiment replicated the principal stages of the spaceflight experiment.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0104830.g001\nTable 1.

First, animals were examined for\nvisible abnormalities in exterior and simple reflexes [19]. The Open\nfield test was performed in a round, 60 cm arena of black plastic\nwith a grey floor and 40 cm high walls [20]. Mouse behavior was\nvideo recorded at 25 fps for 10 minutes under a bright white light\n(200 Lux) followed by 10 min in darkness (IR light). Videos were\nanalyzed for locomotor activity and other behavioral parameters\nusing EthoVision v. 8.5 (Noldus). Grip force was measured using\nGrass FT-03 force transducer [21]. Analog output was amplified,\ndigitized at 1 kHz sampling rate and analyzed using PowerGraph\nsoftware (InteropticaS, Russia). RotaRod test was conducted using\nUgoBasil hardware with rotation speed increased from 6 to\n50 rpm in 3 min, 5 trials were performed with each mouse [22].\nOn the evening of the same day, animals were placed into cages\nof Phenomaster (TSE Instruments, Germany), an automated data\ncollection system, where they were monitored for 7 days. The\nsystem was equipped with an infrared grid to register animal\nactivity, scales for the water bottle and feeder, a running wheel\nwith unrestricted access and rotation counter, an \u2018\u2018operant wall\u2019\u2019\nfor positively reinforced operant conditioning [23]. There were 16\nsuch cages, housing mice individually. Measures were read once\nper minute using TSE software. Blood pressure and heart rate in\nmice, instrumented with telemetry probes were continuously\nrecorded throughout the tests.\nOperant conditioning sessions were conducted automatically,\nonce a day and started at 22:30, controlled by IntelliMaze software\ncontrol. The first session was designed to reinforce nosepokes\nemitted by an animal while both light stimuli (left and right) were\nactive. This session was used to establish individual baseline\ntendencies to display nosepokes to the right or left. On subsequent\ndays, mice were trained to direct nosepokes to the side opposite to\ntheir initial bias. The number of rewarded responses was limited to\n50; each sweetened dry milk pellet weighed 14 mg. To promote\nlearning, mice were maintained at 90% ad lib body weight. Access\nTable 2.

Reward pellets were the alternative source of food.\nThe quality of blood pressure signal (for the operated mice),\nprobabilities of running wheel use, combined with performance in\nconditioning task\nwere\nused as\ncriteria for\ninclusion\ninto\nexperimental groups. Selected mice were randomly assigned to\neither flight or ground control or vivarium groups.\nTransportation\nThe groups of mice designated for flight were transported to\nCosmodrome Baikonur one week before launch. Transportation\nwas by car and by air in several steps and lasted approximately\n24 h. Containers of nontransparent blue plastic 40660 cm with 4\nsub-compartments (each for a group of three mice) equipped with\nair filters (Animal Breeding Facility - Branch of Shemyakin &\nOvchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry) were used. Paste\nfood was provided to mice during transportation.\nStatistical analysis\nOne-way ANOVA (transportation bodyweight data) followed\nby\nBonferroni\u2019s\nmultiple\ncomparisons\nwas\nperformed\nwith\ntransportation bodyweight data. In order the pre/post flight\nbodyweight data set met the assumptions of normality and\nhomoscedasticity intrinsic to the ANOVA model, rank transfor-\nmation was applied to the entire set of observations [24] prior to\ntwo-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons;\nnoteworthy, the results of the test on raw and transformed data\nwere identical. Fisher\u2019s exact test (survival), Man-Whitney U-test\n(home cage food and water consumption, open field test\nbehavioral data) or paired Student\u2019s t-test (metabolic chambers\ndata) was performed using GraphPad Prism software (version 6.00\nfor MacOS, GraphPad Software, USA).\nResults and Discussion\nGroup housing\nLiving conditions for animals considered optimal on earth\ncannot\nbe\nprovided\nin\nthe\nconfines\nof\na\nspace\nsatellite.\nMicrogravity, apart from purely technical limitations of the\nhousing hardware, may disrupt normal mouse behavior, and an\ninability to express natural behavior is posited as a potential cause\nof distress in laboratory animals [25]. This and more obvious\nnegative factors, such as accumulated waste, suboptimal feeding\nregimen etc., can negatively affect mice and could increase\naggressiveness in space habitats. As a result we considered\naggressive interactions a major risk factor. To minimize this risk,\nwe specifically sought to shape the groups for social housing and\ncarefully select stable groups prior to experiments.\nFrom an initial set of 300 male mice, 88 groups of 3 mice were\nformed, a total of 53 groups were used for the space flight (SF)\nexperiment and corresponding SFV, 35 groups for subsequent GC\nand GCV studies (87%). During the co-adaptation period, a total\nof 12 groups had to be rearranged (14%).\nMale mice are known to have aggressive tendencies. Their\naggressiveness depends on a number of factors, including strain\n(C57/BL6 is considered one of the more aggressive strains), living\nspace and other housing conditions and, in the case of group\nhousing, the history of group interactions is a major factor [17]. In\nan animal facility, aggressive interactions are easily overcome by\nsimply removing the aggressor from a group or by individual\nhousing of mature males. Individual housing, however, precludes\nall social interactions and thus compromises the animals\u2019 overall\nwelfare. For this reason, environmental enrichment is often\nemployed in animal facilities, with the goal of reducing aggressive\ninteractions.\nWhile the analysis of measures promoting co-habitation of male\nmice was beyond the scope of the current project, several pertinent\nobservations\nwere\nmade.\nWe\nreasoned\nthat\nenvironmental\nenrichment and daily handling were critically important for\nsuccessful\nco-adaptation\nof\nmice\nand\nthe\ndevelopment\nof\nsustainable hierarchy in the group. In a preliminary experiment,\nwhen no environmental enrichment was used, only 50% of mice\n(out of a sample of 42) successfully co-adapted to living in groups of\nthree. The enrichment used to prepare mice for the Bion-M 1\nexperiments (shelters, nesting material and paper tubes) proved to\nbe useful in two ways. Shelter with good qualities is salient to mice,\nand male mice will compete for the resource [26]. Additionally,\nadequate shelter facilitates the observation of nesting behavior\nwithin the group. Nesting behavior can differentiate groups, with\nstable groups building a communal nest within a chamber,\nwhereas mice that cannot co-adapt as a group compete and fight\nfor the shelter, with one or two mice building a separate nest\noutside of the chamber.\nHandling and other simple manipulations are known to induce\nan acute stress reaction in mice, seen as an increase in blood\npressure, heart rate, body temperature, and plasma corticosterone\n[27\u201330]. At the same time, handling is often used to habituate\nmice and rats to experimental manipulations (mild stress), with\ndifferent handling techniques having different impacts on their\nbehavioral indices [31]. In the course of training for the\nexperiments, mice were handled daily to monitor signs of fighting\nand body weight, and to help identify the provokers and recipients\nof aggression. Frequent handling proved critically important to\ncondition and calm mice to some of the tests. For instance, the \u2018\u2018air\nrighting\u2019\u2019 test used to evaluate vestibular function involved holding\nand rotating individual mice cupped in the palms of the\nexperimenter\u2019s hands prior to releasing the mouse into a safe fall.\nExtensive handling and homecage enrichments yielded male mice\nthat were tractable and cooperative during such potentially\nprovocative procedures. Other, useful and informative observa-\ntions could be made after a change of bedding. Mice become\nextremely active when placed in a fresh cage. We have repeatedly\nobserved that in unstable groups mice would fight promptly after a\nchange of bedding. In summary, fighting episodes observed after\nhandling or cage cleaning, along with an absence of a communal\nnest, were treated as indication that the group had to be either\nrearranged or split and excluded from the experiments.\nFood and water consumption\nThe average pelleted food consumption in SFV and GCV\ngroups was 1.3060.14 g/10 g bodyweight (BW) and their water\nconsumption was 1.5260.65 g/10 g BW (m6sd). Average paste\nfood consumption in the Space Flight and the Ground Control\ngroups was 5.5260.88 g/10 g BW. Taking into account the 76\u2013\n78%, water content of paste food, dry weight consumed was the\nsame\nas that\nfor\npelleted\nfood\nof\n1.2760.20 g/10 g\nBW\n(p = 0.4514, Mann Whitney test). Notably, water intake via the\npaste food diet was 4.2560.67 g/10 g BW, or roughly three times\nad libitum water consumption, when water was presented\nseparately from dry, pelleted diet (p,0.0001, Mann Whitney\ntest). Apparently the need for nutrients, rather than thirst,\ngoverned the paste food consumption.\nWhile no adverse impact of this increased water intake was\nevident, mice maintained on paste diet produced more urine that\nwas more dilute than normal. When paste food was introduced,\nwater consumption decreased roughly 5 times its original amount;\nbody weight increased by 1.560.4 g, and feces weight tripled\nMice in Bion-M 1 Space Mission\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org\n7\nAugust 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e104830\n(Figure 3). Measured urine production in mice fed pasted food diet\nwas 2.4 ml/10 g BW, which was 10 times the value in mice fed\nstandard diet (Student\u2019s paired t = 12.55, df = 3, p = 0.0011).\nTelemetry probes impact on the mice welfare\nContinuous blood pressure measurement, with implantable\ntelemetry probes, was an integral part of the in vivo studies. The\nhealth status and functional state of the implanted mice were\ncarefully monitored after surgery because the novelty of this\nprocedure as part of a long spaceflight constituted a major risk\nfactor for the mission.\nThirty-five (35) mice were implanted with PA-C10 blood\npressure transmitters. The mice tolerated with apparent ease\ntelemetry probe implantation. As can be seen from body weight\ndata, the acute recovery was complete by day 5 post-surgery\n(Figure 4). At approximately the same time, mice were behavior-\nally recovered in terms of locomotor activity and nest building,\nand were reunited with their co-habitants.\nTests of corneal, pineal and other simple reflexes, performance\non RotaRod, grip strength, running wheel performance, and\nlearning and memory tests revealed no adverse effects of probe\nimplantation. We occasionally noted, slight eyelid drooping.\nAlthough this ptosis could be interpreted as indicating compro-\nmised brain blood supply, we do not believe this was the case.\nIndeed, the circle of Willis is incompletely developed in mice, with\n10% incidence in the C57 strain [32]; the right common carotid\nartery was ligated during the surgery. The absence of impaired\nmotor or cognitive functions in implanted mice contradicts\ninterpretations of brain blood supply deficiency. An extracranial\nblood supply through the external carotid could, however, be\ncompromised in operated mice, particularly in the most distal\nbranches of the artery that supply blood to the eyelid. We surmise\nthat was the reason for the slight ptosis observed on the side\nipsilateral to the carotid ligation.\nMice that underwent surgery were housed individually during\nacute recovery period (5 days on average) and were re-introduced\nto their co-habitants when recovered. Two modes of reunion were\ntested. One method was to introduce two un-operated mice to the\ncage of an operated animal. This was designed to exploit \u2018\u2018host-\nintruder\u2019\u2019 paradigm and offer an advantage to the host (operated\n= \u2019\u2019weak\u2019\u2019 mouse) due to concerns for its safety. In nearly all cases,\nhowever, the non-operated \u2018\u2018intruders\u2019\u2019 were the ones to suffer,\nwhen the implanted mouse assumed the dominant position. The\nsecond method was to introduce all three mice to a fresh cage; this\nwas found to be safe for both operated and intact mice. Based on\nin vivo tests conducted before the experiment, we selected the\nlatter mode of reunion. To summarize, when partially recovered\nfrom the operation, mice with implanted probes can be easily\ngroup-housed with intact mice and display little (if any) differences\nfrom mice without surgery.\nPre-flight training of mice designated for in vivo studies\nPreliminary training and tests were performed with 42 mice for\nboth the flight (SF) experiment and the corresponding vivarium\nFigure 3.

The probabilities of mice displaying a good\nBP signal, running vigorously in the wheel, performing well in\ndiscriminative learning, and maintaining amicable interactions\nwith cagemates should be treated as independent and therefore\nshould be multiplied to get the joint probability. Although the rule\nis common knowledge, it is easy to overlook when planning an\nexperiment, and anticipating sufficient allowance of extra animals.\nTransportation\nThe flight group of mice was transported to Cosmodrome\nBaikonur one week before launch. The relatively long (24 h)\ntransportation to Baikonur did not seriously affect the mice as\nevidenced by a slight bodyweight change of 23% (20.9 g,\nFigure 5). Bodyweight returned back to pre-transportation values\nin two days.\nGeneral Outcomes\nClimate\nThe environmental parameters in the biosatellite during the\norbital mission, in the climatic chamber during the ground control\nexperiment, and in the animal facility for the VC groups (Table 4),\nwere closely matched and within the acceptable range for the\nhousing of rodents [33,34]. The climate parameters aboard the\nsatellite were within the designed range throughout the flight [35].\nMice condition after the flight and control experiments\nIn the flight (SF) experiment 16 out of 45 mice (36%) survived\nand in the ground control (GC) experiment, 38 out of 45 mice\nFigure 4.

It should be noted that loss of all mice (n = 15) in\none assembly during space flight was a result of a gross\nmalfunction of the food distribution system. Taking into account\nthat the flight was aimed at exposing mice in the microgravity at,\nrather than evaluating the long established habitat system,\nsurvivorship would be calculated as 16 out of 30 mice (53%).\nLoss of mice in the SF group was obviously higher than in GC (p,\n0.0001, Fisher\u2019s exact test); however, the results of the control\nexperiment are in concordance with data obtained during\npreliminary evaluation of the system, where none of the 15 mice\ndied during a 30-day housing in the habitats (p = 0.1760, Fisher\u2019s\nexact test). Though the comparison of mice survival in our 30-day\nautomated mission with the data obtained in the 91-day MDS\nexperiment aboard the ISS, where astronauts attended to the mice\nand survival rate was 50% (3 out of 6), might be dubious,\nnumerically the values do coincide. Upon examination of the\nsurviving SF mice, 4 (25%) had limb injuries and 6 (38%) had\nvarious tail injuries. These results were quite unexpected taking\ninto account that, during the preliminary evaluation of the system,\nall the mice remained in perfect health after 30 days of housing in\nthe habitats.\nMice behavior during the flight\nTo better understand and interpret the fatalities and injuries\nsustained by some of the mice in the two functioning habitat\nassemblies, we made use of the uniquely rich video data that were\nrecorded from the Bion habitats (see description, above). It should\nbe noted that never before have such extensive video records been\ncollected and that this design feature alone could earn the\n\u2018\u2018modernization\u2019\u2019 tag in the Bion-M1 designation.\nThe library of video recordings from the two habitat assemblies\nconsisted of 2,476, 30-min segments of individual habitats,\ncaptured during both light and dark phases of each day of the\nmission, as described earlier. As might be expected, video quality\nwas superior in the early phases of the flight and visibility was\ncompromised over time, as floating liquids and debris tended to\nobscure the camera lens and the general atmosphere of the\nhabitats. More specifically, at the beginning of first week of space\nflight we categorized as clear with maximal visibility 76% of the\nvideo segments. There was a precipitous decrease in visibility at\nthe beginning of the ensuing weeks: the proportion of such clear\nsegments was only 3% and 6% for the 2nd and 3rd weeks,\nrespectively. On the first day of the final week none (0%) of the\nhabitats were clearly visible in the video records.\nTwo fatalities occurred in different habitats on the 2nd day of\nthe flight. In another cage, one mouse died on the 9th day. There\nwas no evidence of fighting, biting, or agonistic behavior in any of\nthe video samples, so we do not believe that any of deaths or\ninjuries resulted from aggression among the males, evidencing\nsuccess of our effort to train and select stable housing groups. The\nfirst two losses occurred early in the flight, so lack of access to food\ncannot account for them; and again, in no habitat was there visual\nevidence of competition that prevented access to food.\nWhat might help explain the deaths? The video records clearly\nshowed that the mice spent much time in physical contact\n(huddling) with one another and, significantly we think, they were\ngrouped against the flat, feeder wall of the cylindrical habitat\n(Figure 6). We quantified their location within each habitat on\nselect days during the flight; choosing days on which the video\nsegments provided good available visibility. Because we were\ninterested in the aggregative behavior of the mice in different\nareas, we encoded when there were three, two or one individuals\nin contact with the feeder wall, the blank wall, or were in the\nmiddle area of the habitat. When one mouse was in contact with a\nflat wall (feeder or blank) and one or more mice were in contact\nwith it but not necessarily with the wall itself, we scored such\naggregation as being in wall contact. Using these criteria we found\nthat during the 1st day of flight, two or three mice were aggregated\nat the feeder wall for 80% (median value; range: 63%\u2013100%) of\nthe observable segments. They spent 0% of the time at the blank\nwall. On the 3rd flight day, aggregations of two or three mice were\nat the feeder wall for 50% (median; range: 5%\u201395%) of the\nobservation periods and at the blank wall for a median of 0%\n(range: 0%\u201311%). On Day 11, feeder wall aggregations with two\nor more mice occurred for a median of 46% of the observation\ntime and there were no multiple animal aggregations at the blank\nwall.\nFor comparison, we applied the same criteria to the Ground\nControl habitats for the same days during the simulated flight.\nAmong the GC habitats on day 1, aggregations of two or three\nmice were seen for a median of 61% of the time (range: 46%\u2013\n75%) and such aggregations were at the blank wall for only 1.5%\nof the time (range 0%\u20134%). On the third and 11th days the median\ntime aggregations of two or three mice were at the feeder wall was\n79% and 95.5%, respectively; there were no such aggregations at\nthe blank wall.\nIn all, these video samples documented from the first day of\nexperimentation, both in microgravity and on earth, that male\nTable 4.

Individuals were often seen oriented toward the food area,\nwhich was recessed 1 cm. Whether the behavioral orientation\nreflected active feeding of the paste diet, or thigmotactic responses\nto the recess, or grasping of an edge created by the recess or\npresented by the rotating flap, or some combination of such factors\nwas not discernible from the videos. It was clear, however, that\nboth under 1-g and microgravity conditions, the animals spent\nmost of their aggregative time, which was considerable, near or in\ncontact with the feeder wall. In microgravity, the animals assumed\na greater range of orientations at the wall and may have more\nactively inserted their bodies into the recesses or crevasses created\nby the hardware, especially the moving parts. This remains\nsupposition, but appears likely and should be considered in future\ndesigns as well as in the arrangements for video surveillance during\nfuture flights.\nResults obtained in the Bion-M 1 mission should be taken into\naccount in design of new mice habitats for future space missions.\nDespite the general design has long since proven its efficiency in\nthe previous Bion flights with rats, including use of paste food and\nthe system of its distribution, further development is needed to\nbetter adapt it for mice based on this study; obviously any moving\nparts in direct access of the animals should be excluded. The\nadvantage of the habitats design is its ability to support mice\nwithout any human interference in relatively long duration\nmissions. This degree of autonomy has not been reached by any\nother of the existing animal habitats, for instance, in the recent\nMDS mission the water tank had to be refilled every 10 days, and\nwhile food supply was designed to operate automatically for 60\ndays, eventually the food bars had to be manually advanced as\nneeded by the astronauts [10].\nExamination at the landing site\nExamination of mice after the Bion-M 1 flight directly at the\nlanding site (return +3 h) revealed gross motor function impair-\nment: the mice could not maintain steady posture and their fore\nand hind paws were positioned more to their sides, rather than\ndirectly under their trunk (14 of 16, 88%); the mice did not move\neven when prodded; when lifted, the mice spread their toes\nexcessively (16/16, 100%) and righting reaction was absent or\nimpaired in an aerial righting test (6 of 6, 100%). Some recovery of\nlocomotor function was evident by about 6\u20138 h after landing,\nwhen the mice could keep normal posture and even rear. All mice\nwere found to be exophthalmic. Excessive urinations with almost\ncolorless urine were noted in 14 out of 16 mice.\nBody weight data\nThe nutritional status of mice post-flight was variable. Whereas\nthe majority of mice either gained some weight or maintained\ntheir pre-flight values (12/16, 75%), 1 mouse was famished (BW\n50% below pre-flight value), and 3 were distinctly overweight by\n30\u201340%. The differences in bodyweight between spaceflight,\nground control and vivarium control groups were not significant (F\n(3,104) = 1.40, p = 0.2468) and they accounted for only 3% of total\nvariation (Figure 7). Post-hoc comparisons revealed no differences\nbetween the groups before the experiments. The comparison of\npre- versus post-flight values revealed that bodyweight increased in\nthe flight group (8%, p = 0.0010), ground control (4%, p = 0.0456)\nand control vivarium groups (11%, p,0.0001) with overall effect\nof \u2018\u2018time\u2019\u2019 being highly significant (F(1,104) = 59.79, p,0.0001).\nThe relations of main experimental groups (flight and control\nexperiment groups) to the corresponding vivarium controls were\nmirrored: while the flight group had gained, on average, more\nthan the mice housed in the animal facility, mice from the control\nexperiment group gained less weight than their vivarium control\ncounterparts. We consider that this discrepancy is explained by\nlittle opportunity for exercise in the relatively small habitats in\nmicrogravity, and partial loss of mice during the flight experiment,\nleading to excesses of food available to the survivors. In the control\nexperiment, where the effort was made to reproduce the feeding\nregimen observed in the flight experiment, given that more mice\nsurvived, the relative amount of food per mouse was smaller\nleading to smaller weight gain. Seasonal variations in growth\ncannot be ruled out either.\nBehavior in the open-field test\nBehavioral activity of individual mice in the open field was\nrecorded during the training period prior to the start of the\nexperiments and one day after landing (SF and SFV), and at\ncorresponding times for the control groups (GC and GCV); the\nsoftware for behavioral analyses extracted the nine parameters in\nTable 5. After return from 30-day spaceflight mice were markedly\nless active, with both distance (Figure 8A, C) and rearing\nfrequency (Figure 8D) drastically reduced compared to either\nGC or SFV animals, whereas grooming duration (Figure 8H) was\nmuch higher in SF mice compared to any of the control groups.\nInterestingly, both SF and GC mice who were housed in relatively\nsmall habitats displayed more pronounced thigmotaxis compared\nto mice kept in standard cages (SFV or GCV correspondingly), as\nevidenced by a decrease of center zone entries (Figure 8E), time\nspent in center (Figure 8F) and distance moved in center zone,\nwhile latency to the first entry into the center zone was increased\nin SF mice only (Figure 8G). Behavior parameters of mice from\ntwo vivarium groups, SFV and GCV, were indistinguishable.\nThe drastic decrease in activity by SF mice in this test is\nobviously\nrelated\nto\nadverse\nimpact\nof\nprolonged\n30-days\nspaceflight on the sensorimotor systems of these animals.

In contrast, increased housing density,\nexperienced by SF and GC mice, had little effect on the central\narea exploration. In the present case the higher animal density,\nsometimes associated with increased central exploration and\nreduced anxiety [37], did not prevail.\nThe example of OFT data illustrates the efficacy of our training\nprogram and experimental design for promoting scientific output\nof the studies performed with mice after landing in the Bion-M 1\nprogram. Because OFT activity is known to decrease with\nrepetitive tests, the repeated testing approach used in this study\ncould potentially obscure the effects of spaceflight. Nevertheless,\nthe opposite was true. While some of the measures taken before\nthe flight, e.g., distance moved, were very close in different\nexperimental groups with variation coefficients ranging between\n16 and 30%, others differed between the groups and were quite\nvariable within the group, e.g. latency to enter central zone with\nwithin group coefficient of variation of 70\u2013110% (Table 5). In\norder to reduce this inter-individual and seasonal variability,\nresults of preliminary testing were used to make the correction for\nbaseline differences; this transformation made possible differenti-\nation of spaceflight and habitat effects (Figure 8).\nPost-flight adjustment of experimental groups\nDue to the partial loss of mice during the flight, the number of\nanimals in other groups had to be adjusted (Table 6). The number\nof control mice (GC, SFV, GCV) for in vitro studies was decreased\nproportionately to the number of SF animals available. This\ndecision was made basing on the relatively small variability of the\nmeasures to be taken in inbred C57 mice [12] and time\nconsiderations (complete dissection of one animal lasted 1.0\u2013\n1.2 hours and dissection of all the mice took more than 24 hours).\nTaking that accidental death of mice in flight was a random event\nand that bodyweight data from all the animals was available, the\nmice for control groups were selected to match the initial\nbodyweight of SF mice. Different tactics were chosen for the in\nvivo subgroups. The behavioral data were characterized by high\nvariability, at the same time all the animals designated for in vivo\nstudies underwent preliminary testing and selection, taking this\ninto account the number of mice for in vivo studies was not altered\nin order to obtain a better estimate of the behavioral parameters in\nthe batch of mice used and to increase the power of the planned\nanalyses.\nImplementation of the scientific program\nDespite significant loss of animals in flight, the scientific\nprogram was not abridged and was implemented in full.\nHemodynamic and behavioral data were collected throughout\nthe flight. Dissection of SF and SFV mice started 12 hours after\nlanding on May 20th, 2013. Recovery was followed for 7 days in\nthe in vivo subgroup of SF mice and the dissection of these animals\nwas performed on May 26. Joint effort of teams from Russia, USA,\nFrance, Germany, Italy and Ukraine who took part in the in vivo\nstudies and tissue-sharing program resulted in over 70 distinct\nhypothesis-driven studies.\nConclusions\nThe Bion-M 1 flight was unique in many ways, particularly the\nunprecedented duration of an automated mission with living\nanimals. The sex of the mice was male, thus imposing greater\nattention to creation and selection of stable groups of mice for\nsocial housing. The overall success was evident: aggressive\ninteractions were noted on single occasions and under conditions\nof starvation only. The use of male animals is obviously required\nfor research in male reproduction and their larger size compared\nto females offered clear advantages. Our program of mice training\nfor flight and control experiments of the Bion-M 1 project was\naimed to: ensure that mice adapt to stressful conditions of space\nflight when housed in groups; to collect baseline data from these\nmice; select homogenous groups; and, more generally, to promote\ncollection of less variable data. The results of our program\npresented here demonstrate that group housed male mice need not\nbe excluded a priori, but quite on the contrary, can be successfully\nemployed in space biomedical research if clear and simple\nprocedures provided by this study are followed.\nThe failures in this project were connected with hardware\nmalfunction in food distribution system and to microgravity-\nrelated changes in mouse behavior. Some of the injuries and\ndeaths encountered in this pioneering effort suggest moving parts\nwithin the habitat present potential risks and should be avoided or\ncarefully analyzed in the design of future mouse habitats.\nIn this space experiment we have, for the first time, introduced\nimplantable telemetry in these small laboratory animals. This shift\nto data collection during the flight became possible with the\ndevelopment of miniature implantable probes, thereby dramati-\ncally\nincreasing\nthe\nscientific\noutput\nof\nsuch\nexperiments.\nMoreover, the use of an automated data collection system during\nthe post-flight stage of this experiment provided comprehensive\ndata on the course and mechanism of recovery of varied\nphysiological systems following exposure to microgravity. The\nunprecedented inclusion of daily video recordings proved valuable\nfor scientific purposes, for animal welfare considerations, and for\nassessing both nominal and aberrant events.\nThe good condition of spaceflight mice was the basis for the\npositive results of both the recovery and tissue sharing studies;\nleading us to conclude that our training program was generally\neffective. We express our hope that the results and considerations\npresented here will be useful for the planning of future missions\nand will help to ensure the welfare of rodents in space research.\nTable 6.

By contrast, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking was greater than control for all \nradiation doses (p < 0.001). All results were consistent both for monotonic and cyclic loading \nconditions. We conclude that the reductions in bone compressive monotonic strength and fatigue \nlife due to ex vivo ionizing radiation are more likely caused by fragmentation of the collagen \nbackbone than any increases in non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks.\nKeywords\nionizing radiation; bone strength; fatigue; collagen; sterilization; bone-graft\n1 Introduction\nFor a variety of clinical applications, bones are exposed to a wide range of ionizing radiation \ndoses. In vivo, radiotherapy treatment results in an accumulated localized dose of ~50 Gy1 \nin cancer patients [1\u20133]. Ex vivo, bone allografts are sterilized at a dose of 30,000 \u00b1 5,000 \nGy [4,5]. While these high-dose applications are critical for overall patient health and safety, \nhigh levels of ionizing radiation exposure have been shown to increase risk of fracture [6,7]. \nFor example, for women with anal, rectal or colon cancer, those treated with radiation \ntherapy were more than three times as likely to suffer a pelvic fracture than those without \nradiation therapy [8]. Furthermore, for patients with implanted bone allografts, allografts \nsterilized with radiation were twice as likely to fail compared to allografts sterilized using \nother methods [9]. The increased risk of fracture clinically has led to research into the effect \nof high levels of ionizing radiation exposure on the mechanical and biochemical properties \nof bone.\nNumerous ex vivo studies on either cortical or cancellous bone have demonstrated that \nionizing radiation degrades mechanical properties and collagen molecular structure \nindependent of cellular activity. The demonstrated reduction in post-yield properties \u2014 \nultimate strain, ultimate strength, fracture toughness, work-to-failure \u2014 of irradiated bone \n[10\u201315] has been attributed to changes in collagen molecular structure [16\u201318]. Though the \nexact mechanism dominating irradiation-induced collagen degradation is not fully known, \ntwo mechanisms have been suggested as causes for diminished mechanics [10,12\u201314,19\u2013\n23]. First, the collagen backbone can be fragmented when the molecular bonds are cleaved \ndirectly by x- and gamma-rays, breaking the intact protein chain into smaller polypeptides. \nSecond, collagen molecules can be non-enzymatically crosslinked when radiolysis of water \nmolecules creates free radicals, which cause inter- and intra- molecular bonds within \ncollagen chains. However, it remains unclear which mechanism is more causative and at \nwhat dose these mechanisms manifest. Because changes in collagen structure are associated \nwith a number of clinical conditions, an improved biomechanical understanding of each \nmechanism (i.e. non-enzymatic crosslinks and fragmentation) may provide insight into \napplications of irradiation [22], and also aging [24] and diabetes [25\u201328].\n1Abbreviations: Gy, Gray; Nf, Fatigue Life; \u03b5f, Strain-to-Failure; Kelastic, Elastic Stiffness; AGEs, Advanced Glycation End \nProducts; FU, Fluorescence Unit;\nPendleton et al.\nPage 2\nBone.

Specifically, our objectives were to: 1) quantify the effects of \nradiation dose on the monotonic strength and fatigue life of murine vertebrae; and 2) \ndetermine whether the degradation in mechanical properties is dominated by the amount of \nnon-enzymatic crosslinks or fragmented collagen.\n2 Materials and Methods\n2.1 Animals\nForty-eight female, 20-week old (skeletally-mature) C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Labs, \nSacramento, CA) were randomly assigned to five groups (N = 9\u201310 per group). Mice were \neuthanized prior to ex vivo irradiation. All procedures were approved by the University of \nCalifornia Berkeley Animal Care and Use Committee.\n2.2 Specimen preparation\nLumbar vertebrae (L3, L4, L5, S1) were excised and gently cleaned of soft tissue, wrapped \nin saline-soaked gauze (Gibco PBS 1X, pH 7.4), and stored at \u221220\u00b0C. In preparation for \nmechanical testing, the vertebral bodies of the L4 and L5 levels were isolated, endplates \nprecisely planed using a diamond microtome (Leica SP1600 Saw Microtome, Wetzlar, \nGermany) and posterior elements removed [29].\n2.3 Ex Vivo X-Ray Irradiation\nAfter specimen preparation, ex vivo irradiation was performed on all vertebrae. Mice were \nrandomly assigned to one of five dose groups for x-ray irradiation: 0, 50, 1,000, 17,000, or \n35,000 Gy; all vertebral levels from the same animal remained in the same radiation dose \ngroup (e.g. an animal assigned to the 50 Gy group had its L3, L4, L5, and S1 irradiated with \n50 Gy). Irradiation was performed (Advanced Light Source synchrotron facility at Lawrence \nBerkeley National Laboratory) using an x-ray synchrotron micro-tomography beam line, at \n21 keV and 500 mA, for a dose rate of 13.3 Gy/sec (see [30] for details on dose \ncalculations). Specimen hydration was maintained during irradiation via saline-soaked \ngauze.\n2.4 Quantitative micro-CT Imaging\nAfter irradiation, the L4 and L5 specimens were imaged with quantitative micro-CT (\u00b5CT \n50, Scanco Medical AG, Bruttisellen, Switzerland) using a 10-\u00b5m voxel size (55 kV, 109 \n\u00b5A, 1000 projections per 180\u00b0, 500 ms integration time). Micro-CT images of the L4 and L5 \nspecimens were analyzed for height (ImageJ 2.0, Java 1.6.0). The total bone volume of the \nvertebrae was measured on the L5 only (ImageJ 2.0, BoneJ2). After manual segmentation of \nthe trabecular compartment, the following parameters were measured between the top and \nbottom surface of the L5 vertebra: trabecular bone volume fraction (Tb.BV/TV), number \n(Tb.N), thickness (Tb.Th), and separation (Tb.Sp) (Scanco Medical \u00b5CT Evaluation Program \nv6.5) [29]. The micro-CT analysis confirmed successful random sample distribution; there \nwere no significant differences in bone quantity or microarchitecture between the groups.\nPendleton et al.\nPage 3\nBone. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 November 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\n2.5 Mechanical Characterization\nAfter micro-CT imaging, uniaxial compressive monotonic (L4) and cyclic (L5) mechanical \ntesting was performed (TA ElectroForce 3200, Eden Prairie, MN; 25 mm linear encoder, \nmeasured error 9 \u00b5m). Monotonic testing was conducted (displacement rate of 0.01 mm/sec; \nstrain rate ranged from 0.5 to 0.8% strain/s) to provide measurements of stiffness, strength \n(maximum force), ultimate strain (displacement measured by the linear encoder at maximum \nforce divided by specimen height determined via micro-CT) [31], and work-to-fracture \n(Figure 1A).\nCyclic testing was conducted using methods described in detail by Pendleton et al. [29]. In \nbrief, in order to compare the fatigue life across all radiation dose groups, the fatigue test \nwas designed such that the same initial strains were applied to all samples [29]. Using \nmicro-CT based finite element models of each specimen, we computationally derived the \nspecimen-specific forces (Fmin and Fmax) required to achieve the desired initial strains (\u03b5min \n= 0.05% and \u03b5max = 0.5%) during cyclic testing. Thus, specimens were cyclically loaded in \nuniaxial compression between the specimen-specific Fmin and Fmax values until failure (TA \nElectroForce 3200, Eden Prairie, MN; 50 lb. load cell, resolution \u00b10.1 N). Cyclic loading \nproperties measured include fatigue life (Nf) (i.e. number of cycles to failure), strain-to-\nfailure (\u03b5f), and specimen elastic stiffness (Kelastic) (Figure 1B). Cyclic testing was not \nperformed for specimens where the calculated Fmax exceeded the dose group strength \nobserved from monotonic testing, as these specimens would have failed within one loading \ncycle (confirmed by testing a small sample; data not shown).\n2.6 Biochemical Characterization\nAfter irradiation, two biochemical tests (N = 4 specimens for each test) were conducted to \nassess the two primary molecular mechanisms that are thought to alter bone mechanics: (1) \nthe accumulation of non-enzymatic crosslinks was measured on the S1 vertebrae; (2) the \nfragmentation of the collagen backbone was quantified on the L3 vertebrae.\nTo assess non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, we quantified the relative amount of \nfluorescent advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) on the S1 vertebrae. AGEs, which \nform intra- and inter-fibrillar crosslinks along the collagen backbone through oxidation or \nglycation processes [26,32\u201334], were quantified using a fluorometric assay (protocol \nadapted from Sell et al. [35]). Each S1 specimen was demineralized in 0.5 M \nethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and hydrolyzed in 12N HCl at 120\u00b0C for 3 hours to \nbreak down peptide bonds. The hydrolysate was then resuspended in PBS (0.1X) and \npipetted in triplicate onto a black-walled 96 well plate. The non-enzymatic collagen \ncrosslink content was determined using fluorescence readings taken using a microplate \nreader at wavelengths of 370 nm excitation and 440 nm emission. The readings were \nstandardized to a quinine-sulfate standard (quinine dissolved in H2SO4) and then normalized \nto the amount of collagen present in each sample, approximated by the amount of \nhydroxyproline [13,36]. The quantification of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks was \nachieved via the fluorometric assay that determined the relative fluorescence due to \nadvanced glycation end-products (AGEs) relative to the amount of collagen in the bone \nPendleton et al.\nPage 4\nBone. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 November 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nmatrix. The relative amount of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks (fluorescent AGEs) for \neach radiation group was compared to the control.\nTo assess collagen fragmentation, we used an automated electrophoresis assay (2100 \nBioanalyzer, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) to quantify the molecular weight \ndistribution of collagen isolated from the L3 vertebrae. First, we isolated the collagen via \nmethods adapted from Burton et al. [10] (see [30] for details). In brief, L3 specimens were \ndemineralized over 3 weeks in 0.5M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) with the \nsolution changed every 2\u20133 days. Demineralized specimens were defatted for 24-hours in a \n1:1 solution of chloroform and methanol and then soaked in 100% methanol for another \nhour. Specimens were dried in a desiccator overnight, and then flash-frozen with liquid-\nnitrogen and crushed into bone powder using a mortar and pestle. Bone powder was then \nlyophilized (Sequence: \u221238\u00b0C for 180 minutes, \u221238\u00b0C at 120 mTorr for 90 minutes, \u221220\u00b0C \nat 770 mTorr for 900 minutes, \u221210 \u00b0C at 930 mTorr for 270 minutes, and 23\u00b0C at 120 mTorr \nfor 55 minutes) (VirTis AdVantage Plus Benchtop Freeze Dryer XL Model, SP Scientific, \nStone Ridge, NY). For tissue digestion, the powder was added to a solution of 0.5M acetic \nacid and pepsin (1mg of pepsin per 10 mg of bone powder) and placed on a rocker at 4\u00b0C for \n72-hours. To neutralize the digestion process 5M NaOH was added until pH was neutral (pH \n= 6\u20138). To remove non-soluble collagen and non-collagenous proteins, samples were \ncentrifuged for 30 minutes at 13,000 RPM. The supernatant, containing the soluble collagen, \nwas collected. To precipitate the collagen out of solution, solid NaCl was added to a final \nconcentration of 2M NaCl and placed on a rocker at 4\u00b0C for 24-hours. Samples were \ncentrifuged for 30 minutes at 13,000 RPM. The supernatant was removed, and the pellets \nwere resuspended in 200 uL of 0.5M acetic acid. Samples were then lyophilized and stored \nat \u221220\u00b0C until electrophoresis. In preparation for electrophoresis, the isolated collagen was \ndissolved in 1X PBS, mixed with additional reagents (Agilent Technologies Protein 230 \nManual), and loaded on a bioanalyzer chip for automated electrophoresis. Rat-tail collagen \n(Sigma Aldrich, C7661\u201325MG) was run as a standard. From this assay, the distribution of \nmolecular weights of the collagen protein was assessed in two ways: (1) visually with a \nsoftware-generated \u201cgel\u201d and (2) quantitatively with a software-generated fluorescence unit \n(FU) chart, called an \u201celectropherogram\u201d (Agilent 2100 Expert software). The nominal size \nof a type-I collagen, either alpha-1 or alpha-2, is between 130\u2013150 kDa. To identify chain \nfragmentation, we looked for evidence of less protein in this range, and a wider distribution \nof molecular weights. On the gel, this was observed as a lighter-colored band or smeared \nband at ~150 kDa. On the electropherogram, fragmentation can be observed when the peak \nat ~150 kDa is diminished, indicating fewer fluorescence units and therefore fewer collagen \nchains of the nominal size. The quantification of collagen fragmentation was achieved via \nthe software-generated electropherogram by comparing the quantity of fluorescence units \n(FU) at the nominal collagen chain length (~150 kDa) for each radiation group to the \ncontrol.\n2.7 Statistics\nWe used a one-way ANOVA to test for radiation effects, followed by Dunnett\u2019s post-hoc test \n(at p \u2264 0.05) to compare each group against the control (0 Gy) (JMP v 14.0, SAS Institute). \nFor those measurements that were not normally distributed (ultimate strain), a Kruskal-\nPendleton et al.\nPage 5\nBone. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 November 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nWallis test was conducted instead, followed by the Steel post-hoc to compare each group \nagainst the control (JMP v 14.0, SAS Institute). In order to compare the magnitude of \nresponses across the different measurements \u2013 vertebral strength, crosslink AGEs, and \nfragmentation fluorescence \u2013 each datum for the individual specimen was normalized by the \nmean value of that measurement for the control group. Then, the means of these normalized \nvalues for the crosslink AGEs and fragmentation fluorescence measurements were \nindividually compared against the mean normalized value for vertebral strength, using a \nStudent\u2019s t-test (p \u2264 0.05) (JMP v 14.0, SAS Institute).\n3 Results\n3.1 Mechanical Characterization\nFor monotonic compression testing, the vertebral strength, ultimate strain, and work-to-\nfracture were lower than the control group for radiation exposures of 17,000 and 35,000 Gy \nbut were not different than the control group for exposures of 50 and 1,000 Gy. Compared to \nthe control group, for the exposures of 17,000 and 35,000 Gy, vertebral strength was 50% \nand 73% lower (p < 0.001, Figure 2), respectively, ultimate strain was 58% and 77% lower \n(Steel post-hoc p < 0.05, Figure 2), and work-to-fracture was 76% and 92% lower (p < 0.01, \ndata not shown). In contrast, monotonic stiffness remained unchanged for all radiation dose \ngroups compared to the control group (691.3 \u00b1 179.5 N/mm; p = 0.67, Figure 2).\nSimilar trends, but more accentuated, were observed for the cyclic properties. Monotonic \nstrength of 17,000 and 35,000 Gy groups were less than the prescribed cyclic loading force, \nFmax, and thus cyclic testing was not conducted for these two groups since the specimens \nwould have fractured after one cycle of loading (confirmed by testing a small sample, data \nnot shown). Fatigue life (5.2 \u00b1 0.4 log(cycles); p = 0.50, Figure 2), strain to failure (3.8 \n\u00b1 1.0 %; p = 0.41, data not shown), and elastic stiffness (1273 \u00b1 162 N/mm; p = 0.31, data \nnot shown) for the 50 and 1,000 Gy exposures did not differ from the control.\n3.2 Biochemical Characterization\nThe relative amount of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks (fluorescent AGEs) was greater \nfor all radiation groups by nearly twofold, and increased in a dose-dependent manner: by \n67%, 95%, 96%, and 108% for 50, 1,000, 17,000 and 35,000 Gy, respectively, compared to \nthe control (42.2 \u00b1 2.3 ng quinine / mg collagen; p < 0.001, Figure 2).\nIn contrast, collagen fragmentation was only observed at doses of 17,000 and 35,000 Gy \n(Figure 2). Fragmentation at these doses was observed on both the software-generated gel \n(Figure 3A) and electropherogram (Figure 3B). On the gel, a dark band was visible at the \nnominal collagen chain length of 150 kDa for samples of 0, 50, and 1,000 Gy. This band \nbegan to lighten at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy, indicating fewer collagen proteins of this chain \nsize. Also, a \u201csmearing\u201d of bands was observed below 150 kDa, suggesting that there was a \ngreater amount of collagen fragmented chains with lower molecular weights. On the \nelectropherogram, the same result can be observed. The peak fluorescence unit found at 150 \nkDa for 17,000 Gy decreased by 74% compared to the control (460 \u00b1 72 FU; p < 0.02).\nPendleton et al.\nPage 6\nBone. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 November 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nWhen comparing the magnitudes of the effects across the different (normalized) \nmeasurements, for all radiation doses, the normalized values were higher for crosslinking \nthan for vertebral strength (p < 0.01) (Figure 4). By contrast, the normalized values for the \nunfragmented collagen chains were not different than for vertebral strength (p > 0.55), \nexcept at the 17,000 Gy dose, for which the difference was significant (p = 0.03) but small \n(vertebral strength 0.50 \u00b1 0.06; fragmentation 0.26 \u00b1 0.03) (Figure 4).\n3.3 Quantitative micro-CT Imaging\nThe micro-CT analysis confirmed successful random sample distribution; there were no \nsignificant differences in bone quantity or microarchitecture between the groups. Total bone \nvolume (1.41 \u00b1 0.16 mm3, p = 0.71, data not shown), as well as trabecular bone volume \nfraction (18.79 \u00b1 0.94 %, p = 0.20, Figure 2), number (3.92 \u00b1 0.13 1/mm, p = 0.35, data not \nshown), and separation (256.97 \u00b1 8.81 \u00b5m, p = 0.47, data not shown) were the same for all \ngroups. ANOVA results for trabecular thickness were significant (p = 0.036), however a \nTukey post-hoc analysis found no differences between any groups (50.17 \u00b1 68 \u00b5m, p > 0.05, \ndata not shown).\n4 Discussion\nThese results demonstrate that the monotonic strength of murine vertebral bodies was only \ndiminished when exposed to ionizing radiation at or above 17,000 Gy. While the relative \namount of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks was greater for all radiation groups compared \nto the control, the increase in crosslinks measured at lower doses (50 and 1,000 Gy) did not \ncoincide with the observed reduction in mechanical strength (Figure 4). In contrast to \ncrosslinks, collagen fragmentation was only observed at doses where reduced mechanical \nproperties were also observed (17,000 and 35,000 Gy; Figure 4). Thus, our results suggest \nthat the fragmentation of collagen \u2014 and not the accumulation of non-enzymatic collagen \ncrosslinks \u2014 was the primary molecular mechanism that caused the observed reductions in \nmechanical properties in whole bones exposed to ionizing radiation.\nOur results are consistent with previous radiation studies and provide novel insight into the \neffect of ex vivo ionizing radiation on bone mechanics. In accordance with previous \ninvestigations of cortical bone, we observed a reduction in both monotonic and fatigue \nproperties at a dose equivalent to nominal allograft sterilization of ~30,000 \u00b1 5,000 Gy \n[10,15,20,37\u201339], and a reduction of monotonic strength at 17,000 Gy [11]. While our study \nis consistent with earlier observations, our findings expand upon previous knowledge in \nthree important areas. First, previous inquiries have been conducted on either cortical \n[10,11,15,20,37\u201339] or trabecular [40] bone tissue specimens, not whole-bones. Second, \nmechanical characterization has been primarily conducted in either monotonic or fatigue \nloading conditions, not both. Finally, only a subset of these studies has conducted concurrent \ncollagen biochemical analysis, quantifying either crosslinks [13] or fragmentation \n[10,37,39]. For the first time, we have demonstrated the effect of irradiation on whole-bones \n(with both cortical and trabecular tissue) across a spectrum of clinically-relevant doses (i.e. \nradiation therapy at 50 Gy to allograft sterilization at 35,000 Gy) with both monotonic and \nfatigue mechanical tests, as well as parallel collagen biochemical assays. We expand on the \nPendleton et al.\nPage 7\nBone. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 November 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nwork of Currey et al. [11] and demonstrate that in addition to a reduction in monotonic \nstrength following irradiation at 17,000 Gy, fatigue properties are also significantly reduced. \nImportantly, we have demonstrated the doses at which the differences in collagen structure \nand mechanics arise. Our results provide new insight into the type of molecular change \ndriving the degradation of whole-bone strength and fatigue life following irradiation.\nWhile the exact collagen modifications dominating reduced strength following irradiation \nare not fully understood, we examined the two proposed mechanisms: photon-induced \nfragmentation of the collagen backbone [10,20] or radiolysis-induced non-enzymatic \ncollagen crosslinks [12,13,21\u201323]. Our results suggest that increased collagen \nfragmentation, and not non-enzymatic crosslinking, is the dominant factor. While no \nprevious studies have quantified the fragmentation of collagen in irradiated whole-bones, our \nresults are in agreement with previous work on cortical bone, which demonstrated that \ndiminished fracture toughness at doses of ~35,000 Gy was a result of collagen fragmentation \n[10,37]. Expanding on this knowledge, we demonstrate that collagen fragmentation leads to \ndegraded murine whole-bone mechanics at 17,000 Gy, a dose signifiantly lower than the \nstandard for allograft sterilization (25,000 \u2013 35,000 Gy). Our findings emphasize the need \nfor further research into novel radioprotectants that target fragmentation in order to maintain \nbone strength when sterilizing allografts with radiation [10].\nImportantly, our findings suggest that non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks may play a smaller \nrole in degrading mechanical strength of bone than previously considered. Previously, \nnumerous studies attributed the increase in non-enzymatic crosslink concentration as the \nprimary mechanism for degraded bone strength, specifically in applications of natural aging \n[24,36,41], drug treatments [42], irradiation sterilization [13], and diseases such as \nosteoporosis [43] and diabetes [26,44\u201347]. While the concentration of non-enzymatic \ncrosslinks does accumulate in bone collagen in these applications, any causation of those \ncrosslinks with respect to degraded mechanical properties has not been established. Here, we \nobserved that despite a substantial (95%) increase in crosslink concentration, we could not \ndetect any effect on vertebral strength. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that an increase in \nnon-enzymatic crosslinks induced via ribose incubation can be used to counter the loss of \nstrength due to the fragmentation of the collagen network, not degrade it further [39,48,49]. \nTaken together, our results strengthen the argument that the contribution of non-enzymatic \ncrosslinks to diminished bone strength with disease and aging plays a smaller role in \ncomparison to other factors, such as collagen network connectivity [50].\nThere are some limitations in this study. First, because we tested mouse bone, the direct \napplication of our findings to human bone is unclear. However, as discussed above, similar \ntrends in irradiation-induced degraded bone strength [10,11,15,20,37\u201339,51\u201355] and \nmolecular-level changes [10,55] have been seen in other studies across a number of \nanatomic sites and species, including human bone. That consistency suggests our results are \nnot limited to murine bone. Second, as an ex vivo study, we excluded the impact of any \nbiologically induced responses to radiation in order to explore the extent to which radiation \ndirectly alters the mechanical behavior of the bone matrix. For applications of allograft \nsterilization, which are only conducted ex vivo, excluding cellular effects is appropriate. \nHowever, for in vivo applications of radiation therapy, there can be cellular-driven changes, \nPendleton et al.\nPage 8\nBone. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 November 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nsuch as reduced bone volume fraction or altered trabecular microarchitecture [50], which \ncan alter bone mechanics beyond what is reported here. Thus, our method of irradiation is \ndirectly comparable to ex vivo allograft sterilization; for doses equivalent to in vivo \nradiotherapy treatment (50 Gy), our method is only applicable when considering the direct \neffects of radiation on the bone matrix. Additionally, we performed all mechanical tests, \nmonotonic and cyclic, in compression. While compressive loading is most relevant for in \nvivo behavior, the response may be different for isolated specimens tested in pure tension.\nFinally, because our study did not investigate doses between 1,000 and 17,000 Gy, it is \nunclear at what dose within this range reduced mechanical properties can first be observed. \nTo address this gap, we conducted a post-hoc study for doses of 5,000 and 10,000 Gy (see \nAppendix) with the same mechanical and biochemical assays described above. We found \nsome mechanical differences occurred with radiation exposure of 5,000 Gy (and above), but \nonly for cyclic loading: compared to the control, fatigue life was lower by 18% (p < 0.01) \nbut monotonic strength was not different (p = 0.12). These ad hoc results confirm previous \nobservations that cyclic loading may be a more sensitive test than monotonic loading for \ndetecting mechanical effects of radiation [13,20]. Clinically, radiation-induced fractures are \noften observed months to years after irradiation and classified as spontaneous or \ninsufficiency fractures (i.e. fractures which are not the result of a fall or trauma, and more \nlikely due to repetitive loading at low forces over time) [56\u201358]. As such, it is clinically \nimportant to consider mechanisms that can affect cyclic loading properties differently than \nstatic loading properties. Furthermore, our findings have expanded our knowledge to show \nfatigue properties are also significantly reduced with doses as low as 5,000 Gy.\nClinically, our results have implications for safe sterilization of allografts and potential \nradioprotectants. A dose of 11,000 Gy has been proposed as a safe sterilization dose for \nallografts [59], as this dose achieves the same sterility level as the current standard dose of \n30,000 \u00b1 5,000 Gy [4,5]. However, our supplemental findings suggest collagen \nfragmentation and associated loss of cyclic mechanical properties can begin with a dose as \nlow as 5,000 Gy (see Appendix). To mitigate the loss of mechanical integrity, further studies \nare needed to investigate how to safeguard the bone with a radioprotectant. Several \nradioprotectants have been considered for their ability to preserve tissue properties following \nirradiation [4,49,60]. Based on our results, we would recommend studies focused on \nradioprotectants which can prevent or offset the fragmentation of collagen, as these types of \nradioprotectants may preserve bone mechanics to a greater degree than those which protect \nagainst non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks.\nOur results also have implications for understanding the etiology of the increased fracture \nrisk associated with in vivo radiation therapy treatment for cancer [2,8,61\u201366]. We did not \nobserve any change in mechanical behavior for ex vivo dose levels relevant to radiation \ntherapy (i.e. 50 Gy), despite an increase in collagen crosslinks. Thus, direct effects of \nradiation on the collagen matrix from radiation therapy are not solely responsible for the \nincreased fracture risk observed clinically. From this, we can infer that the cellular processes \nof bone remodeling due to in vivo irradiation are likely the root cause. Indeed, previous in \nvivo irradiation studies of bone in a murine model have shown reduced trabecular bone \nmass, number and connectivity associated with hyperactive osteoclast activity [67\u201369]. \nPendleton et al.\nPage 9\nBone. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 November 01.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nTaken together with our ex vivo observations, cell-mediated changes in bone quantity, \ntrabecular microarchitecture, or tissue material quality are more plausible explanations for \nthe increased fracture risk from radiation therapy than direct changes to the bone material.\nIn summary, we quantified the level of collagen fragmentation and non-enzymatic collagen \ncrosslinks in the organic matrix of murine whole-bones at clinically-relevant ex vivo \nradiation doses. Our results suggest that the fragmentation of collagen \u2014 and not the \naccumulation of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks \u2014 was the primary molecular \nmechanism that caused the observed monotonic mechanical degradation at 17,000 Gy and \nabove, and cyclic mechanical degradation at 5,000 Gy and above.\nAcknowledgements\nThis study was supported by NASA Science & Technology Research Fellowship NNX14AM56H (MMP), National \nScience Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program #1752814 (SRE), a NASA Space Biology PECASE \n(JSA), and grants from the National Institutes of Health (K01AR069116, R21AR069804, R01AR07444) (SYT). \nThis research used resources of the Advanced Light Source, which is a DOE Office of Science User Facility under \ncontract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.

As detailed \nabove, we measured mechanical properties, collagen crosslinks, and collagen fragmentation \n(data not shown). We observed compressive fatigue life to be lower for the irradiated groups, \nbeing 18% (p < 0.01) and 37% (p < 0.0001) lower for 5,000 and 10,000 Gy doses, \nrespectively, compared to the control (5.0 \u00b1 0.4 log(cycles)). We detected no significant \neffect of radiation dose for any of the compressive monotonic mechanical properties, either \nfor strength (p = 0.12), stiffness (p = 0.62), or maximum displacement (p = 0.51). Collagen \ncrosslinks increased significantly for all irradiated groups, by 71% and 101% for 5,000 and \n10,000 Gy, respectively (p < 0.05). Collagen fragmentation was evident for 5,000 Gy, \nobserved as a significant decrease in the amount of nominally sized collagen chains (~150 \nkDa) compared to the 0 Gy control (p = 0.008); data for the 10,000 Gy group was lost due to \na processing error. These findings suggest that doses well below sterilization standards \n(30,000 \u00b1 5,000 Gy) and a proposed alternative (11,000 Gy) may compromise the \nmechanical strength and collagen integrity of bone allografts, making them more susceptible \nto failure under cyclic loading [4,5,59].\n6 References\n[1].

Mutations in and loss of DGC proteins cause a spectrum of muscular dystrophies. When only\nthe sarcoglycan subcomplex is absent, muscles display severe myofiber degeneration, but little susceptibility to\ncontractile damage, suggesting that disease occurs not by structural deficits but through aberrant signaling,\nnamely, loss of normal mechanotransduction signaling through the sarcoglycan complex. We extended our\nprevious studies on mechanosensitive, \u03b3-sarcoglycan-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, to determine whether\nadditional pathways are altered with the loss of \u03b3-sarcoglycan.\nMethods: We examined mechanotransduction in the presence and absence of \u03b3-sarcoglycan, using C2C12\nmyotubes, and primary cultures and isolated muscles from C57Bl/6 (C57) and \u03b3-sarcoglycan-null (\u03b3-SG-/-) mice. All\nwere subjected to cyclic passive stretch. Signaling protein phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting\nof lysates from stretched and non-stretched samples. Calcium dependence was assessed by maintaining\nmuscles in calcium-free or tetracaine-supplemented Ringer\u2019s solution. Dependence on mTOR was determined\nby stretching isolated muscles in the presence or absence of rapamycin.\nResults: C2C12 myotube stretch caused a robust increase in P-p70S6K, but decreased P-FAK and P-ERK2. Neither\nAkt nor ERK1 were responsive to passive stretch. Similar but non-significant trends were observed in C57 primary\ncultures in response to stretch, and \u03b3-SG-/- cultures displayed no p70S6K response. In contrast, in isolated muscles,\np70S6K was mechanically responsive. Basal p70S6K activation was elevated in muscles of \u03b3-SG-/- mice, in a\ncalcium-independent manner. p70S6K activation increased with stretch in both C57 and \u03b3-SG-/- isolated muscles,\nand was sustained in \u03b3-SG-/- muscles, unlike the transient response in C57 muscles. Rapamycin treatment blocked\nall of p70S6K activation in stretched C57 muscles, and reduced downstream S6RP phosphorylation. However, even\nthough rapamycin treatment decreased p70S6K activation in stretched \u03b3-SG-/- muscles, S6RP phosphorylation remained\nelevated.\nConclusions: p70S6K is an important component of \u03b3-sarcoglycan-dependent mechanotransduction in skeletal\nmuscle. Our results suggest that loss of \u03b3-sarcoglycan uncouples the response of p70S6K to stretch and implies\nthat \u03b3-sarcoglycan is important for inactivation of this pathway. Overall, we assert that altered load-sensing\nmechanisms exist in muscular dystrophies where the sarcoglycans are absent.\nKeywords: Sarcoglycan, Sarcoglycanopathies, Limb girdle muscular dystrophy, Mechanotransduction, Mechano-sensing,\nLoad-sensing, p70S6K, S6K, p70S6 kinase, ERK1/2\n* Correspondence: erbarton@dental.upenn.edu\n1Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, School of Dental Medicine,\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA\n2Pennsylvania Muscle Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA,\nUSA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2014 Moorwood et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Skeletal Muscle 2014, 4:13\nhttp://www.skeletalmusclejournal.com/content/4/1/13\nBackground\nThe dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) is found at\nthe sarcolemma of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle\ncells, where it physically links the extracellular matrix\n(ECM) with the intracellular cytoskeleton, providing struc-\ntural support [1-3]. Mutations in DGC components cause\ndifferent types of muscular dystrophy; for example, muta-\ntions in dystrophin cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy\n(DMD), while mutations in \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, or \u03b4-sarcoglycan\n(SG) cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) [2-4].\nWhen dystrophin is mutated in DMD or in the mdx\nmouse model of DMD, the entire DGC is substantially\nreduced at the sarcolemma. In contrast, when any one of\nthe SGs is mutated, in LGMD or any of the SG knock-out\nmice, the other three SGs are either absent or reduced at\nthe sarcolemma, but the rest of the DGC remains, includ-\ning the link formed by dystrophin and dystroglycan be-\ntween the ECM and the cytoskeleton [2,3,5,6]. Unlike the\nskeletal muscles of the mdx mouse, muscles of the \u03b3-SG\nknock-out (\u03b3-SG-/-) mouse display no mechanical fragility,\nat least until 4 months of age, as shown by a minimal loss\nof force-generating capacity following a series of eccentric\ncontractions (ECCs) [7,8]. In spite of this, the \u03b3-SG-/-\nmouse exhibits a severe dystrophic phenotype on histo-\nlogical examination, with extensive myofiber degeneration\nand regeneration, fibrosis, and disruption of sarcolemmal\nintegrity, similar to the mdx mouse [9]. The lack of\nmechanical fragility suggests that aberrant signaling\nmay contribute to the muscle degeneration seen in the\n\u03b3-SG-/- mouse. Indeed, our previous studies demon-\nstrated that localization of the SG complex to the sarco-\nlemma and phosphorylation of the tyrosine 6 residue of\n\u03b3-SG are essential for normal signaling by extracellular\nsignal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), in response\nto ECCs [10,11]. Based upon these data, we have\nasserted that the SG complex acts as a mechanosensor\nin skeletal muscle because of its position within the\nDGC, the modifications that occur to \u03b3-SG with mech-\nanical perturbation, and the necessity of the complex\nfor normal signaling.\nA complication of using ECCs to invoke signal transduc-\ntion is that there are multiple processes in play. Not only is\nthere externally applied tension on the sarcolemma and\nDGC as a result of lengthening, but also active contraction\nresulting in internally applied tension and Ca2+ flux within\nthe fibers and across the sarcolemma, all of which could\ncontribute to alterations in signaling in the absence of\n\u03b3-SG. Calcium is known to be involved in many mechano-\nsensitive signaling pathways (reviewed in [12,13]) and aber-\nrant calcium regulation is a feature of SG-deficient muscle\n[14-22]. Indeed, an exaggerated ERK1/2 response to mech-\nanical stimulation that is dependent on extracellular cal-\ncium has been demonstrated in the mdx mouse diaphragm\n[23]. Studies suggest that aberrant calcium regulation in\nthe muscular dystrophies results from abnormal levels and\nactivity of the mechanosensitive TRP channels and/or mis-\nregulation of store operated calcium entry via the STIM1\nand Orai1 channels [24-29]. Direct disruption of the sarco-\nlemma, for which there is evidence in SG-null animal\nmodels [7,9,30,31], could also contribute to loss of calcium\nhomeostasis. Furthermore, several strategies to improve\nCa2+ handling are known to counteract the pathology as-\nsociated with the muscular dystrophies [25,32-34]. There-\nfore, identification of mechanosensitive signaling that is\nattributable to the SG complex rather than other pro-\ncesses occurring during mechanical perturbation has been\nchallenging.\nOne pathway of interest involves p70S6K, which is ca-\nnonically activated in response to mitogens via the phos-\nphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway (reviewed in [35])\nand is known to respond to mechanical load [36]. Acti-\nvation of p70S6K involves a hierarchical series of phos-\nphorylation events, beginning with phosphorylation of\nmultiple sites in the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain,\nfollowed by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-\ndependent phosphorylation of sites in the linker region,\nwhich allows for full activation of the kinase via phos-\nphorylation of threonine 229 (T229) in the catalytic do-\nmain by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)\n(reviewed in [37]). Although phosphorylation of T229 is\nrequired for p70S6K activation, phosphorylation of T389\nin the linker region has been found to correlate most\nclosely with in vivo activity [38], and can be used as a\nmeasure of kinase activation. p70S6K has a multitude of\ndownstream targets, with roles in protein synthesis,\ngrowth, proliferation, survival, and more [35], including\nS6 ribosomal protein (S6RP), which closely correlates\nwith protein translation rates [39].\nIn the current study, we examined ERK1/2, Akt, focal\nadhesion kinase (FAK), and p70S6K responses to passive\nstretch in C57 and \u03b3-SG-/- skeletal muscle to further eluci-\ndate the importance of the SG complex for mechanotrans-\nduction. While differences in ERK1/2 phosphorylation\nbetween C57 and \u03b3-SG-/- muscle were calcium-dependent,\ndifferences in p70S6K activation were independent of cal-\ncium. In addition, the p70S6K response to stretch in both\nprimary myofiber cultures and isolated extensor digitorum\nlongus (EDL) muscles was differentially regulated in the\nabsence of \u03b3-SG. Specifically, experiments in isolated\nmuscles suggest that \u03b3-SG is required for inactivation of\np70S6K. The findings increase our understanding of the\ncontribution of aberrant load-sensing to the pathology of\nmuscular dystrophies where the SG complex is deficient.\nMethods\nAnimals\nAdult C57BL/6 (C57) and \u03b3-SG-null (\u03b3-SG-/-) mice were\nused. For ex vivo protocols, mice were aged 8 to 16 weeks.\nMoorwood et al. Skeletal Muscle 2014, 4:13\nPage 2 of 13\nhttp://www.skeletalmusclejournal.com/content/4/1/13\nThe \u03b3-SG-/- mouse lacks \u03b3-SG due to gene targeting,\nresulting in an additional loss of \u03b2- and \u03b4-SG and a de-\ncrease of \u03b1-SG [9]. All experiments were approved by the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and\nUse Committee.\nC2C12 myotube culture\nFlexible silicone membranes (Specialty Manufacturing,\nInc.) were stretched across the bottom of custom cylinders\nwhich acted as a culture chamber. The membranes were\nheld in place using an O-ring as described previously [40].\nMembranes were then coated with a thin layer of 2 mg/mL\nGFR Matrigel (BD #354230). C2C12 myoblasts (3.5 \u00d7 105/\ncylinder) were seeded onto the membranes and maintained\nat 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C in growth media (10% FBS, 100 U\npenicillin, 100 \u03bcg streptomycin, 100 \u03bcg/mL gentamycin\nin DMEM) for approximately 24 h until 70% to 80%\nconfluent, then switched to differentiation media (2%\nHS, 100 U penicillin, 100 \u03bcg streptomycin, 100 \u03bcg/mL\nGentamycin in DMEM). Myoblasts were allowed to\ndifferentiate into multinucleated myotubes for 5 days,\nduring which media was changed every other day before\nstretching as described below.\nPrimary myoblast culture\nMice were euthanized using CO2 inhalation. Flexor digi-\ntorum brevis (FDB) muscles were dissected and incu-\nbated with 2 mg/mL collagenase I (Sigma), 10% FBS in\nTyrode\u2019s solution (125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM\nCaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES\n(all from Fisher), 5.5 mM glucose (Sigma), pH 7.4) for\n90 min at 37\u00b0C, with shaking, as previously described\n[41]. Muscles were washed in 10% FBS in Tyrode\u2019s solu-\ntion and clumps of fibers were liberated by pipetting up\nand down in 10% FBS, 100 U penicillin, 100 \u03bcg strepto-\nmycin in Tyrode\u2019s solution using a wide-mouthed glass\npipette. Clumps of fibers were transferred to a second\ndish with the same solution and pipetted up and down\nagain. Single fibers were transferred to a third dish be-\nfore plating on silicone membranes coated with Matrigel\n(Becton Dickinson; 2 mg/mL diluted in DMEM). Growth\nmedia (20% FBS, 10 ng/mL mouse basic fibroblast growth\nfactor (MP Bio), 100 U penicillin, 100 \u03bcg streptomycin,\n1 \u03bcg/mL Fungizone, 100 \u03bcg/mL Gentamycin in Ham\u2019s\nF-10 media) was carefully added and cultures were incu-\nbated without disturbance for 3 days at 37\u00b0C. Media was\nthen changed every 2 days. After 7 to 10 days, when myo-\nblast cultures were 70% to 80% confluent, media was\nswitched to differentiation media (10% HS, 0.5% chicken\nembryo extract, 100 U penicillin, 100 \u03bcg streptomycin,\n1 \u03bcg/mL Fungizone, 100 \u03bcg/mL Gentamycin in DMEM)\nand myoblasts were allowed to differentiate into multinu-\ncleated myotubes for 5 days before stretching as described\nbelow. Unless otherwise indicated, all cell culture reagents\nwere purchased from Gibco.\nMyotube stretching protocol\nC2C12 myotubes were stretched using an apparatus that\nproduces isotropic two-dimensional strain of cells in vitro,\nas described previously [40]. Briefly, myotubes were sub-\njected to 10% strain, 40 times per minute, for 30 min, at\n37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Control\nmyotubes were treated identically but were not stretched.\nLysates were harvested immediately as described below.\nPrimary myotubes were stretched using the protocol\ndescribed for C2C12 myotubes. Stretched myotubes were\nthen incubated without stretch for a further 1, 2, or 4 h at\n37\u00b0C before harvesting lysates for immunoblotting as\ndescribed below. Control (non-stretched) myotubes were\nharvested immediately after the end of the stretching\nprotocol used for the stretched myotubes.\nIsolated muscle stretching protocol\nMice were anaesthetized using ketamine and xylazine. EDL\nmuscles were dissected and placed in an organ bath\ncontaining oxygenated high-glucose (25 mM) DMEM with\nHEPES (25 mM) (Life Technologies), at room temperature.\nFor rapamycin sensitivity experiments, high-glucose DMEM\nwas supplemented with 150 nM rapamycin (Sigma) or ve-\nhicle only (0.1% DMSO). Muscles were adjusted to 9.3 mN\nof resting tension, approximately equivalent to optimal\nlength, based on our previous experiments [42]. After a\n10-min equilibration period, the length of the muscle was\nmeasured using calipers, and the muscle was subjected to\na stretching protocol of 15% strain (held for 100 ms with\nramp times of 50 ms), 20 times per minute, for either 30\nor 90 min, using an in vitro muscle test system (Aurora\nScientific). Muscles were snap-frozen immediately follow-\ning the end of the stretch protocol. Contralateral muscles\nwere used as controls and were adjusted to the same length\nas the stretched muscles, then incubated in oxygenated\nhigh-glucose DMEM with HEPES at room temperature for\nthe equivalent length of time, before snap-freezing.\nCalcium dependence experiments\nEDL muscles were dissected as described above and\nplaced in an organ bath contained oxygenated Ringer\u2019s\nsolution (119 mM NaCl, 4.74 mM KCl, 2.54 mM CaCl2,\n1.18 mM KH2PO4, 1.18 mM MgSO4, 25 mM HEPES,\n2.75 mM glucose), calcium-free Ringer\u2019s solution (CaCl2\nreplaced with 2.5 mM MgCl2) or Ringer\u2019s solution sup-\nplemented with 100 \u03bcM tetracaine. They were incubated\nfor 30 min before snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen.\nImmunoprecipitation\nImmunoprecipitation experiments were carried out using\nthe Pierce Classic IP kit (Thermo Scientific). Muscle lysates\nMoorwood et al. Skeletal Muscle 2014, 4:13\nPage 3 of 13\nhttp://www.skeletalmusclejournal.com/content/4/1/13\ncontaining 100 \u03bcg total protein was immunoprecipitated\nwith anti-P-tyrosine (Cell Signaling #9411 1:100) overnight\nat 4\u00b0C with end-over-end mixing. Samples were purified\nusing Protein A/G Plus Agarose beads (Roche) for 1 h\nat 4\u00b0C with end-over-end mixing. The immune complex\nwas eluted with non-reducing sample buffer and boiled\nat 100\u00b0C for 5 min before being applied to a SDS-PAGE\ngel, transferred, and immunoblotted as described below.\nImmunoblotting\nC2C12 and primary myotubes were washed with ice-cold\nPBS before lysing in 100 to 200 \u03bcL of RIPA buffer (50 mM\nHEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA,\n15 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium hexahydral, 1%\nNP-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 0.025% sodium azide)\nwith protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma).\nLysates were incubated on ice for 30 min, centrifuged at\n16,000 rcf for 20 min at 4\u00b0C and the supernatants retained.\nEDL muscles were ground using a dry ice-cooled pestle\nand mortar, and lysed in 200 \u03bcL of RIPA buffer with prote-\nase and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were incubated on\nice for 1 h, vortexing half-way through, centrifuged at\n16,000 rcf for 20 min at 4\u00b0C and the supernatants retained.\nProtein content was determined using a Bradford method\nprotein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Lysates (30 \u03bcg total protein for\nmyotube cultures, 90 \u03bcg total protein for EDL muscles)\nwere separated by SDS-PAGE on Tris-HCl polyacrylamide\ngels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to PVDF membranes.\nMembranes were blocked in 5% milk in TTBS (10 mM\nTris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% v/v Tween-20, pH 8), with 2%\nBSA added for some antibodies, then probed with\nantibodies to the following: phospho (P)-p70S6K (T389)\n(Cell Signaling #9205 1:200 for primary cultures, Cell\nSignaling #9234 1:250 for isolated muscles), P-p70S6K\n(T421/S424) (Cell Signaling #9204 1:1,000), P-S6RP (Cell\nSignaling #2211 1:2,000), P-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling #9101\n1:500), total (T)-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling #9107 1:1,000),\nP-Akt (Cell Signaling #9271 1:300), T-Akt (Cell Sig-\nnaling #2920 1:2,000), P-FAK (Millipore 05-1140, 1:500),\nT-FAK (Millipore 06-543, 1:1,000), \u03b3-SG (Novocastra\nVP-G803 1:300), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase\n(GAPDH) (Santa Cruz sc-32233 1:5,000), and tubulin\n(Sigma T5168 1:20,000). Band intensities were quantified\nusing ImageQuant TL, 1D gel analysis (C2C12 and myo-\ntube cultures, rapamycin sensitivity experiments) or ImageJ\n(NIH) (all other isolated muscles). P-p70S6K and P-S6RP\nwere normalized to either GAPDH or tubulin, P-FAK was\nnormalized to either T-FAK or GAPDH, P-Akt was normal-\nized to T-Akt, and P-ERK1/2 was normalized to T-ERK1/2.\nMicroscopy\nImages of primary cultures were taken using a Leica DM\nRBE microscope and Leica DFC300 CCD camera, using\nOpenLab software (Perkin Elmer).\nStatistics\nComparisons between non-stretched and stretched C2C12\ncells (Figure 1) were done by unpaired T test. Comparisons\nbetween C57 and \u03b3-SG-/- primary cultures across time\n(Figure 2) were done by two-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s\nmultiple comparisons test. Comparisons between C57 and\n\u03b3-SG-/- muscles in calcium experiments (Figure 3) were\ndone by unpaired T test. Comparisons between C57 and\n\u03b3-SG-/- muscles with and without stretch for each time\npoint (Figure 4) or with and without rapamycin (Figure 5)\nwere done by two-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s multiple\ncomparisons test.\nResults\np70S6K, but not ERK1/2 or Akt responds to passive\nstretch in vitro\nStudies using whole muscles from animal models of the\ndystrophies are made more complex by the presence of\nmultiple cell types, as well as pathological processes such\nas fibrosis. Therefore, we initially investigated mechano-\ntransduction signaling in passively stretched C2C12\nmyotubes. We found that passive stretching in vitro did\nnot alter phosphorylation of ERK1 or Akt and that ERK2\nand FAK phosphorylation decreased following stretch\n(Figure 1A,C-F,H-I). However, we found an increase in\np70S6K phosphorylation at T389, which reflects activity,\nin response to passive stretching of C2C12 myotubes\n(Figure 1B,G). Therefore, this in vitro model reflected\nsome, but not all, stretch responses observed in muscle\nin vivo [43,44], and highlighted p70S6K as a pathway of\ninterest. The lack of Akt phosphorylation suggests that\np70S6K phosphorylation\noccurred\nthrough\nan Akt-\nindependent pathway, while the lack of FAK phosphoryl-\nation supports an integrin-independent mechanism.\nDifferential p70S6K stretch response occurs in C57 and\n\u03b3-SG-/- primary cultures\nHaving established pathways of interest in vitro using the\nC2C12 cell line, we used primary myoblast cultures from\nC57 and \u03b3-SG-/- mice (Figure 2A) to investigate the\nchanges in mechanotransduction signaling associated\nsolely with the loss of the SG complex in myofibers. C57\nand \u03b3-SG-/- cultures were stretched for 30 min as de-\nscribed above and lysates were harvested 1, 2, or 4 h after\nstretching ended, to allow observation of the signaling\ntime course. Immunoblotting analysis showed that there\nwas no difference in basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation\nbetween C57 and \u03b3-SG-/- myotubes and little change in\nERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to stretch (Figure 2B,\nD,E). Therefore, similar to the C2C12 cells, primary\ncultures did not reflect the ERK1/2 phosphorylation\nresponses found previously in C57 and \u03b3-SG-/- mice\nin vivo [10,11]. Neither P-Akt nor P-FAK displayed\nsignificant differences between C57 and \u03b3-SG-/- cultures\nMoorwood et al. Skeletal Muscle 2014, 4:13\nPage 4 of 13\nhttp://www.skeletalmusclejournal.com/content/4/1/13\n(Figure 2B,F,G). Further, these proteins did not show\nany prolonged response to passive stretch in the\nprimary cultures, consistent with the lack of an acute\npositive stretch response in C2C12 cells. Examination of\np70S6K revealed a trend towards elevated T389 phos-\nphorylation at baseline in \u03b3-SG-/- myotubes, compared\nto C57 myotubes. Activation of p70S6K in \u03b3-SG-/- myo-\ntubes upon stretch was not apparent (Figure 2B,C), but\nC57 myotubes displayed a trend for increased activation\nat 2 and 4 h after stretching (Figure 2B,C). Therefore,\nwhile the primary cultures reflect some of the responses\nfound in C2C12 myotubes, the experimental system is\ntoo variable to draw firm conclusions regarding mech-\nanical signaling pathways associated with \u03b3-SG.\nElevated P-p70S6K in \u03b3-SG-/- muscles is calcium\nindependent\nOur experiments in myotubes, together with our previ-\nous studies in isolated muscles [10,11], suggested that\nERK1/2 phosphorylation changes require active contrac-\ntion in addition to stretch, whereas p70S6K responds to\nstretch alone. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we ex-\ntended our analysis to examine the response of p70S6K\nto passive stretch of isolated muscles. P-p70S6k was\nelevated approximately 1.7-fold in resting \u03b3-SG-/- EDL\nmuscles incubated in normal oxygenated Ringer\u2019s solu-\ntion (Figure 3C; Normal). As in our previous studies,\nthere was a 3- and 1.5-fold increase of P-ERK1 and\nP-ERK2, respectively, in resting \u03b3-SG-/- EDL muscles\n(Figure 3A-B; Normal). Because both of these pathways\nconverge to phosphorylate S6RP, we compared the\nphosphorylation state of this protein in muscles from\nboth genotypes. \u03b3-SG-/- EDL muscles exhibited an 8-fold\nincrease in P-S6RP, which was consistent with the higher\nbasal phosphorylation state of the upstream pathways\n(Figure 3D; Normal).\nHeightened mechanosensitive signaling could arise through\nincreased flux of ions across the sarcolemma, particu-\nlarly Ca2+ [17]. This could occur either through en-\nhanced activity of channels, such as the TRP family of\ncation channels (reviewed in [28,29]), or via membrane\nruptures. To determine the calcium dependence of the ob-\nserved differences in p70S6K and ERK1/2 phosphorylation\nin \u03b3-SG-/- muscles, we incubated muscles in calcium-free\nRingers solution, retaining the same ionic strength.\nAbsence of extracellular Ca2+ did not alter the relative\ndifference in P-p70S6K between \u03b3-SG-/- and C57 muscles\n(Figure 3C). However, the increased P-ERK1/2 and\nP-S6RP found in \u03b3-SG-/- muscles in normal Ringer\u2019s solu-\ntion was abrogated when there was no calcium in the\nbathing solution (Figure 3A,B,D). Thus, only p70S6K\nphosphorylation appeared to be calcium independent. Be-\ncause intracellular calcium stores can also alter the intra-\ncellular calcium concentration, particularly during muscle\nactivation, tetracaine was used to inhibit sarcoplasmic\nreticulum release of Ca2+ through the ryanodine receptors.\nVerification of this inhibition was established in a separate\nexperiment, through measuring tetanic force generation\nby EDL muscles before and after addition of tetracaine.\nAfter 15 min incubation with tetracaine, force production\nwas virtually eliminated (force was 297 mN prior to\naddition of tetracaine, 2.4 mN after 15 min incubation\nwith tetracaine and not detectable after 20 min incubation\nwith tetracaine). Again, relative P-p70S6K levels between\nthe two muscle groups were not altered by tetracaine\n(Figure 3C). In contrast, blockade of SR Ca2+ release\nreduced P-ERK1 levels in \u03b3-SG-/- muscles relative to C57\nmuscles, even though there was no alteration in P-ERK2\nFigure 1 p70S6K responds to stretch in C2C12 cells.

Phosphorylation of S6RP remained elevated\nin \u03b3-SG-/- muscles in the presence of tetracaine, but to a\nlesser extent than in normal Ringer\u2019s solution (Figure 3D).\nTaken together, both extracellular and intracellular cal-\ncium contribute to the heightened P-ERK1 levels in\n\u03b3-SG-/- muscles, whereas the increase in basal P-p70S6K\nin \u03b3-SG-/- muscles is not dependent on either extracellular\nor intracellular calcium.\nDifferential p70S6K stretch response occurs in isolated\nC57 and \u03b3-SG-/- muscles\nHaving established that P-p70S6K changes at rest did not\ndepend on calcium, we pursued the role of p70S6K in\n\u03b3-SG-dependent mechanotransduction in vivo. A passive\nstretching protocol comprised of a 15% strain, 20 times\nper min, for 30 min in high-glucose DMEM was sufficient\nto cause increased \u03b3-SG phosphorylation in the EDL, as is\nthe case for eccentric contraction of the EDL (Figure 4A;\n[10]). We stretched C57 and \u03b3-SG-/- EDL muscles for\neither 30 or 90 min and immediately snap-froze them in\nliquid nitrogen. We then used immunoblotting to meas-\nure phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389, as above, and also\nat T421/S424 in the auto-inhibitory domain. Basal phos-\nphorylation of p70S6K at T389 showed a trend to be in-\ncreased in unstretched \u03b3-SG-/- muscles compared to C57\nmuscles (Figure 4B,C).

After 30 min of stretch, phosphoryl-\nation of p70S6K at T389 and T421/S424 was increased to\na similar degree in stretched C57 and \u03b3-SG-/- EDL mus-\ncles, compared to non-stretched controls. However, after\n90 min of stretch, phosphorylation at T389 and T421/\nS424 had decreased in stretched C57 muscles and was\nclose to non-stretched levels. In contrast, phosphorylation\nat T389 was further increased, and T421/S424 phosphor-\nylation remained elevated, in stretched \u03b3-SG-/- muscles,\ncompared to non-stretched controls (Figure 4B-D). For\nT389 phosphorylation after 90 min of stretch, genotype,\nstretch, and the interaction between them were all statisti-\ncally significant, by two-way ANOVA. T421/S424 showed\na similar trend to T389; however, while the effect of\nstretch was statistically significant, the difference between\ngenotypes was not. Thus, in contrast to primary cultures,\n\u03b3-SG-/- muscles exhibited heightened and prolonged\nactivation of p70S6K in response to passive stretch, imply-\ning that \u03b3-SG plays a role in p70S6K inactivation.\nStretch response of p70S6K T389, but not S6RP, is\nrapamycin-sensitive in \u03b3-SG-/- muscles\nBecause mTOR is a key mediator of p70S6K activation,\nwe examined the effect of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin\non stretch responses in isolated C57 and \u03b3-SG-/- muscles.\nEDL muscles were subjected to cyclic stretch for 90 min,\nas described above.

Rapamycin treatment completely blocked the\nincrease in p70S6K T389 phosphorylation after passive\nstretch of C57 muscles, consistent with previous studies\n[36,37]. In \u03b3-SG-/- muscles, rapamycin abrogated most\np70S6K T389 phosphorylation, but residual phosphorylation\nFigure 3 Elevated p70S6K in \u03b3-SG-/- muscles is independent of calcium.

T421/S424\nshowed a trend to increase in response to stretch in both\nC57 and \u03b3-SG-/- muscles. Surprisingly, rapamycin blunted\nthe p70S6K T421/S424 stretch response in C57 muscles,\nwhich is inconsistent with previous studies [36]. However,\nthe T421/S424 response to stretch persisted in \u03b3-SG-/-\nmuscles in the presence of rapamycin (Figure 5A,D).\nS6RP phosphorylation increased in response to stretch\nin both C57 and \u03b3-SG-/- muscles. Interestingly, while\nrapamycin blocked stretch-induced phosphorylation of\nS6RP in C57 muscles, phosphorylation in response to\nstretch was preserved in \u03b3-SG-/- muscles (Figure 5A,E).\nTaken together, these results suggest either that the level\nof active p70S6K remaining in \u03b3-SG-/- muscles is suffi-\ncient to phosphorylate S6RP regardless of rapamycin or\nthat an alternate pathway bypasses p70S6K to phos-\nphorylate S6RP in muscles lacking \u03b3-SG.\nDiscussion\nSkeletal muscle has a remarkable ability to adapt to\nchanges in workload. Almost all muscle properties can\nbe modulated, such as muscle fiber size, contractile\nproperties and metabolism. Changes in patterns of gene\nexpression as well as shifts in the balance between pro-\ntein synthesis and degradation are required to complete\nthe adaptational response. Identification of major path-\nways that directly regulate gene expression and protein\nsynthesis/degradation demonstrate that multiple inputs\n(mechanical, chemical, and metabolic) can converge\non final common pathways for muscle growth and\nadaptation (reviewed in [45]). However, sorting out the\ncontribution of the wide variety of inputs on muscle\nadaptation has been more difficult. In our previous\nwork, we used an eccentric contraction protocol to in-\nvestigate the dependence of ERK1/2 mechano-sensing\non phosphorylation of \u03b3-SG. However, this protocol\nalters multiple factors, including externally applied\ntension, internally generated tension and changes in\nextracellular and intracellular calcium fluxes, all of\nwhich potentially have effects on mechanosensitive\nsignaling pathways. In the present study, we used a\npassive stretching protocol to isolate the effects of ex-\nternally applied tension in the absence of active contrac-\ntion, in order to examine the downstream signaling in\nmore detail.\nPassive stretching protocols can be performed in both\ncell cultures and whole muscle preparations, and the\nreductionist approach of utilizing cultures can eliminate\nsome of the physiological complexities associated with\nintact or isolated muscles. As such, our initial experi-\nments using C2C12 cells were key to identifying p70S6K\nas being activated in response to stretch, in contrast to\nthe lack of response by ERK1/2, Akt, or FAK. Primary\nmyotubes generated from C57 or \u03b3-SG-/- mice had the\nFigure 4 Differential p70S6K stretch response in isolated C57\nand \u03b3-SG-/- muscles.

Even\nthough these experiments displayed trends towards differ-\nential activation of p70S6K after stretch, the inherent\nvariability of the preparation impaired identification of\nsignaling patterns that were dependent upon either stretch\nor \u03b3-SG. Thus, we returned to isolated muscles from C57\nand \u03b3-SG-/- mice to investigate \u03b3-SG-dependent mechano-\ntransduction pathways. Using this model, we observed a\nmodest increase of P-p70S6K in \u03b3-SG-/- muscles at rest\nthat was independent of intra- or extracellular calcium,\nand a prolonged activation of p70S6K following stretch.\nThese results support a role for \u03b3-SG in particular, or the\nSG complex in general, in mechanical signal transduction,\nwhere the loss of this protein leads to an increase in\nactivation, and deficit in deactivation, or a combination of\nboth. Given the dependence of our findings on the experi-\nmental platform utilized, future directions will include\nverification of the results in an even more intact system,\nsuch as in situ muscle preparations or whole animals.\nAn intriguing explanation for our in vivo results is that\n\u03b3-SG is required for dephosphorylation and deactivation\nof p70S6K. There is considerable evidence that p70S6K\nis directly dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2A\n(PP2A), independently of mTOR [46-49]. The phosphat-\nase PHLPP has also been shown to target p70S6K [50].\n\u03b3-SG may mediate the activation of these phosphatases\nin response to sustained mechanical stimulation. Alter-\nnatively, \u03b3-SG may regulate pathways that deactivate\np70S6K indirectly. For example, the phosphatase SHP-2\ncan cause mTOR-dependent dephosphorylation of p70S6K\n[51,52]. Further studies will be required to define the inacti-\nvation pathway disrupted by \u03b3-SG loss.\nPassive stretch eliminates the contribution of active con-\ntraction or SR calcium fluxes, but does not eliminate the\nFigure 5 Stretch response of p70S6K T389, but not S6RP, is\nrapamycin-sensitive in \u03b3-SG-/- muscles.

Further, as previously shown, passive\nstretch causes greater Ca2+ influx into myotubes lacking\nmembers of the SG complex [17], raising the possibility\nthat the mechanical signal transduction pathways we eval-\nuated previously may be modulated not only by the SG\ncomplex, but also by additional channels in the sarco-\nlemma. To address this, we examined the contribution\nof calcium to the elevated p70S6K and ERK1/2 activity\nfound in \u03b3-SG-/- muscles. We found that the elevation of\nP-ERK1/2 in the absence of \u03b3-SG was dependent on both\ninternal and external sources of calcium. In contrast, the\ndifference in basal P-p70S6K between C57 and \u03b3-SG-/-\nmuscles was not calcium dependent. This suggests that\nwhile ERK1/2 activation may lie downstream of the cal-\ncium misregulation that occurs in SG-deficient muscle,\nchanges in p70S6K activation may be a more direct conse-\nquence of the absence of the SG complex. This is of great\ninterest given that \u03b3-SG has been shown to be important\nfor mechanotransduction, but the downstream signaling\npathways are uncharacterized [10,11]. Furthermore, p70S6K\nhas been implicated in mechanotransduction in skeletal\nmuscle, but the upstream initiation signals are not\nknown [36,53-55]. However, it should be noted that\nSG-deficient muscle undergoes substantial degeneration\nand subsequent regeneration, which may also explain\nthe elevated basal p70S6K, which is transiently increased\nduring regeneration [56].\nOur study found that the pattern of differential p70S6K\nphosphorylation in response to stretch in \u03b3-SG-/- muscles\nwas similar both for phosphorylation of T389, which cor-\nrelates with kinase activity, and for T421/S424, two of the\nfour phosphorylation sites in the autoinhibitory domain.\nPhosphorylation of T389 is mTOR-dependent, while\nphosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain is carried\nout by proline-directed kinases. Furthermore, it is thought\nthat phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain is ne-\ncessary for phosphorylation of T389 [37]. The correlation\nbetween phosphorylation of T421/S424 and T389 in our\nisolated muscle model therefore suggests that phosphoryl-\nation of the autoinhibitory domain was the rate-limiting\nstep for p70S6K activation, an intriguing prospect given\nthat the autoinhibitory domain may be targeted by ERK1/\n2 [57]. Therefore, a future hypothesis to test is that differ-\nential p70S6K activation is a downstream consequence\nof differential ERK1/2 activation in \u03b3-SG-/- muscle. This\nwould implicate Ca2+ as an indirect modulator of p70S6K\nactivity, since the increase in P-ERK1/2 in \u03b3-SG-/- muscle\nis dependent upon heightened Ca2+ flux. It is worth noting\nthat recent work by others has shown that stretch-\ninduced activation of mTOR and p70S6K at T389 is inde-\npendent of ERK1/2 [54], which can regulate mTOR via\ntuberous sclerosis proteins 1 and 2 and Raptor [58-60].\nHowever, this pathway is separate from the putative direct\nphosphorylation of the p70S6K T421/S424 autoinhibitory\ndomain sites by ERK1/2.\nOur experiments with rapamycin showed that, for both\nC57 and \u03b3-SG-/- muscles, phosphorylation of p70S6K at\nT389 is mTOR-dependent, consistent with previous stud-\nies [36,37]. The T421/S424 autoinhibitory domain sites\nwere phosphorylated in response to stretch in both C57\nand \u03b3-SG-/- muscles, which was different to our initial\nexperiment in stretched isolated muscles, where the C57\nresponse had diminished by 90 min of stretching. How-\never, in the presence of rapamycin, this response was\nnot present. This is surprising given that the T421/S424\nsites are not thought to be targeted by mTOR. Previous\nstudies have shown these sites to be rapamycin-insensitive\n[36], but recent evidence suggests a modest mTOR de-\npendence [61]. In \u03b3-SG-/- muscles, rapamycin had no ef-\nfect on T421/S424 phosphorylation. Further experiments\nare needed to fully understand the role of mTOR on phos-\nphorylation of the p70S6K autoinhibitory domain in C57\nand \u03b3-SG-/- skeletal muscle. Interestingly, the stretch-\ninduced phosphorylation of S6RP was rapamycin sensitive\nin C57 muscles, but not in \u03b3-SG-/- muscles. This suggests\nthat an alternative pathway can bring about S6RP phos-\nphorylation in \u03b3-SG-/- muscles when p70S6K is not acti-\nvated. One possibility is that S6RP is phosphorylated by\np90 ribosomal S6 kinase, which is activated by ERK; this is\nconsistent with the increase in basal ERK1/2 in \u03b3-SG-/-\nmuscles, and the over-response of ERK2 on mechanical\nstimulation by eccentric contraction [10].\nWe did not observe a strong Akt response to passive\nstretch, or any difference between C57 and \u03b3SG-/-, im-\nplying that mTOR and/or p70S6K were being activated\nthrough Akt-independent pathways. This is consistent\nwith previous studies showing that Akt does not respond\nto mechanical stimulation in skeletal muscle, and that\np70S6K phosphorylation in response to stretch is inde-\npendent of PI3K [62]. We also did not see increased\nphosphorylation of FAK in response to passive stretch in\nC2C12 cells or primary myotubes. Although integrins can\nparticipate in mechanotransduction, it appears that our\ncyclic passive stretch protocols did not cause integrin\nactivation. Further studies will be needed to elucidate\nthe details of crosstalk between SG-dependent and\nintegrin-dependent signaling pathways, as well as the\nrole of calcium in these signaling cascades.\nBased on our findings, we position \u03b3SG as a mechano-\nsensor, schematized in Figure 6, that is important for tran-\nsient ERK1/2 activation during active contractions, as\nwell as modulation of p70S6K activation during passive\nstretch. Because passive stretch does not appear to in-\ncrease P-FAK or P-Akt, \u03b3SG is likely to regulate p70S6K\nthrough other pathways. These may include regulation\nof ERK1/2, which can promote p70S6K activation indir-\nectly via mTOR or directly by phosphorylation of the\nMoorwood et al. Skeletal Muscle 2014, 4:13\nPage 10 of 13\nhttp://www.skeletalmusclejournal.com/content/4/1/13\nautoinhibitory domain, and/or phosphatases such as\nPP2A that dephosphorylate p70S6K. Loss of \u03b3SG un-\ncouples the response to stretch, which may contribute\nto muscle pathology.\nThe stability of the SG complex is directly affected in\nseveral LGMDs and in DMD, and a significant part of the\npathology in these diseases appears to be inappropriate\nload sensing. The first step in therapeutic development is\nidentifying and understanding the target, but little is cur-\nrently known about the role of the SG complex in load\nsensing. Therefore, understanding the functions that are\ndisrupted and the pathways that are involved in mechano-\ntransduction involving the SG complex will help in the de-\nsign of therapies for LGMDs and DMD. While restoration\nof a completely normal SG complex either through gene\ncorrection or protein replacement would also normalize\nmechanical signal transduction, this may not be possible\nfor all mutations responsible for DMD and LGMD. It is\nknown that localization of the SG complex is not the sole\ncriterion for appropriate signaling [11]. Hence, other\nproteins may be necessary to correct signaling even when\nthe complex is restored, and downstream pathways may\nemerge as more feasible therapeutic targets. We do not\nknow whether the enhanced basal and stretch-responsive\nactivation of p70S6K in \u03b3-SG-/- muscle contributes to\npathology or compensates for it. Likewise, it is not clear\nwhether inhibition of p70S6K would have a beneficial or\na detrimental effect in dystrophic muscle. Muscle specific\ngene targeting of mTORC1 components induces myopathy\n[63,64] and overexpression of integrin \u03b17 can improve the\ndystrophic phenotype through increased survival signaling\nvia p70S6K [65], suggesting that p70S6K inhibition would\nnot be advantageous. However, treatment of mdx mice\nwith the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin improves the dys-\ntrophic phenotype [66]. It is also interesting to note that\np70S6K is inhibited by glucocorticoids, which are used in\nthe treatment of DMD and LGMD [67].\nOur results begin to provide mechanistic insight into\nhow mechanical signaling is disrupted and altered in the\nabsence of \u03b3-SG. In addition to increasing our under-\nstanding of the normal function of the SG complex,\nthere is potential to provide more refined targets that\ncould be beneficial to patients either in isolation or in\ncombination with other therapeutic approaches.\nConclusions\nWe have identified p70S6K as part of a novel SG-\ndependent mechanosensitive signaling pathway in skeletal\nmuscle. Our results suggest that \u03b3-SG is required for the\ninactivation of p70S6K following its activation in response\nto mechanical stimulation. These studies provide new\ninsights into the normal function of the SG complex, and\nthe mechanisms by which its deficiency in some forms of\nmuscular dystrophy may contribute to pathology.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions\nCM carried out the calcium dependence experiments and the stretching\nexperiments in isolated muscles, and drafted the manuscript.

Many Rab-like proteins exist in plants, but only a subset have been\nfunctionally characterized.\nResults: Here we report that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c play important roles in pollen development, germination\nand tube elongation. AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants have no obvious morphological changes compared\nwith wild-type plants across a variety of growth conditions. An AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is also indistinguishable\nfrom wild-type plants during vegetative growth; however its siliques are shorter than those in wild-type plants.\nCompared with wild-type plants, AtrabD2b/2c mutants produce deformed pollen with swollen and branched\npollen tube tips. The shorter siliques in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were found to be primarily due to the\npollen defects. AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have different but overlapping expression patterns, and they are both\nhighly expressed in pollen. Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c protein localize to Golgi bodies.\nConclusions: These findings support a partially redundant role for AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in vesicle trafficking\nduring pollen tube growth that cannot be fulfilled by the remaining AtRabD family members.\nBackground\nRas-like small GTP-binding proteins (GTPases) regulate\ndiverse processes in eukaryotic cells including signal\ntransduction, cell proliferation, cytoskeletal organization\nand intracellular membrane trafficking. GTPases are\nactivated by GTP binding and inactivated by subsequent\nhydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP, thus acting as mole-\ncular switches in these processes [1,2]. The Rab GTPase\nfamily is the largest and most complex within the Ras\nprotein superfamily. Rab GTPases are important regula-\ntors of endomembrane trafficking, regulating exocytosis,\nendocytosis and membrane recycling processes in eukar-\nyotic cells [3-6]. Rab GTPase functions have been exten-\nsively studied in yeast and mammalian systems. Both in\nvivo and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that\ndifferent Rab proteins function in distinct intracellular\nmembrane trafficking steps and they are hypothesized to\nwork together with soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive\nfactor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins to\npromote specificity of vesicle transport to target com-\npartments and facilitate vesicle and target membrane\nfusion [7-13]. They are therefore essential for the trans-\nport of proteins and membrane through the endomem-\nbrane system to their destination.\nThe Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes 93 putative\nRas superfamily proteins. Fifty-seven of these are Rab\nGTPases, more than in yeast but similar to the number\nin humans [13,14]. According to their sequence similar-\nity and phylogenetic clustering with yeast and mamma-\nlian orthologs, these Rab proteins were assigned to eight\nsubfamilies, AtRabA to AtRabH, which can be further\ndivided into 18 subclasses [13]. Relatively few of the\nplant Rab orthologs have been investigated functionally.\nMost of these studies have used constitutively active\n(CA) and/or dominant negative (DN) mutations, gener-\nated by direct mutation of the conserved domain to\nrestrict mutant GTPase proteins to the active GTP-\nbound form (constitutively active) or inactive GDP-\nbound form (dominant negative). Expression of CA or\n* Correspondence: bassham@iastate.edu\nDepartment of Genetics, Development and Cell Biology, Iowa State\nUniversity, Ames, IA 50010, USA\nPeng et al.

For a\nnumber of plant Rab GTPases, expression of their CA\nand DN mutants in transformed plants, together with\nprotein localization information, has shown that these\nRabs perform functions similar to those of their yeast\nand mammalian orthologs [15-19].\nSeveral reports indicate that Rab proteins are impor-\ntant for elongation of tip-growing cells in plants. For\nexample, AtRabA4b is reported to localize to the tips of\nroot hair cells and was proposed to regulate membrane\ntrafficking through a compartment involved in the\npolarized secretion of cell wall components [18]. NtRab2\nGTPase is important for trafficking between the endo-\nplasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies in tobacco pollen\ntubes and may be specialized to optimally support the\nhigh secretory demands in these tip growing cells [16].\nNtRabA (Rab11) in tobacco is predominantly localized\nto an inverted cone-shaped region at the pollen tube tip,\nand both constitutively active and dominant negative\nmutants resulted in reduced tube growth rate, meander-\ning pollen tubes, and reduced male fertility [20].\nThere are four genes in the Arabidopsis RabD subfam-\nily, AtRabD1 (At3g11730), AtRabD2a (At1g02130,\nAtRab1b),\nAtRabD2b\n(At5g47200,\nAtRab1a)\nand\nAtRabD2c (At4g17530, AtRab1c) [13]. In mammals, the\northologs of AtRabD, Rab1 isoforms, physically associate\nwith the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and\nGolgi and regulate membrane trafficking between the\nER and Golgi complex [21]. Fluorescent protein fusions\nwith AtRabD1, AtRabD2a and AtRabD2b localize to the\nGolgi and trans-Golgi network [22,23], and transient\nexpression in plant cells of dominant negative mutants\nof rabD2a or rabD1 resulted in the inhibition of ER-to-\nGolgi trafficking [15,22,24], suggesting a related function\nfor the plant Rab1 homologs. Pinheiro et al. [22] isolated\nT-DNA insertion mutants in each of the AtRabD family\ngenes and reported that each of the single and double\nmutants lacked a detectable phenotype. By contrast, a\nrabD2a rabD2b rabD2c triple mutant was lethal and a\nrabD1 rabD2b rabD2c triple mutant had stunted growth\nand low fertility, indicating that these gene family mem-\nbers perform important and overlapping functions.\nWe previously hypothesized that closely related\ngenes with a high Pearson correlation in their RNA\naccumulation level are functionally redundant, and\nshowed that expression patterns of both the AtRabD2b\nand AtRabD2c genes are negatively correlated with the\nprocess of starch synthesis [25], whereas the expression\npatterns of the remaining RabD genes are not. We\ntherefore predicted that these two Rab proteins may\nhave redundant functions that are not shared by the\nother two AtRabD family members. Here we show that\nAtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are highly correlated in their\nRNA accumulation level across a variety of experimen-\ntal conditions. Phenotypic analysis of knockout\nmutants indicates that they are at least partially func-\ntionally redundant, and are important in pollen devel-\nopment and pollen tube growth. The proteins both\nlocalize to the trans-Golgi, consistent with their pro-\nposed role in trafficking from the ER to the Golgi\napparatus.\nResults\nThe expression patterns of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are\nclosely correlated\nThe four RabD family members in Arabidopsis share\nabout 88% identity at the amino acid level. The accu-\nmulation pattern of the associated transcripts is quite\ndistinct across a wide variety of experimental condi-\ntions and developmental stages (MetaOmGraph, http://\nwww.metnetdb.org/MetNet_MetaOmGraph.htm; [26])\n(Table 1; Additional file 1, Table S1). AtRabD2b and\nAtRabD2c expression patterns are correlated (at a\nPearson correlation value of 0.72), whereas AtRabD1\nand AtRabD2a show very low correlation with the\nothers (Pearson correlation value of < 0.20). Based on\ntheir high sequence similarity (99% amino acid iden-\ntity) and the correlation between their mRNA accumu-\nlation patterns, we hypothesized that AtRabD2b and\nAtRabD2c might have some functional overlap that is\nnot shared by AtRabD1 and AtRabD2a.\nIdentification of Null Mutations in the Genes AtRabD2b\nand AtRabD2c\nIt was reported previously that an AtrabD2b AtrabD2c\ndouble mutant has no phenotype [22]. Based on our\ncorrelation analysis above, we hypothesized that this\nmutant may have some more subtle defects that cannot\nbe compensated for by the remaining family members.\nTo investigate this further, we identified T-DNA inser-\ntion mutants (Figure 1A) in AtrabD2b (3 alleles) and\nAtrabD2c (1 allele). Homozygous lines for the T-DNA\ninsertions were identified by PCR, using primers\nselected by iSct primers (http://signal.salk.edu/tdnapri-\nmers.2.html), and the insertion sites were determined by\nsequencing the PCR products (Figure 1B). Analysis of\nmRNA levels by RT-PCR indicated that AtrabD2b-1,\nAtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1 are null mutants.

AtrabD2b-2 was supplied as a\nhomozygous line. To generate AtrabD2b AtrabD2c dou-\nble mutants, AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1 homozygous\nsingle mutants were crossed, F1 plants were allowed to\nself fertilize and the AtrabD2b-2/AtrabD2c-1 double\nmutant was identified from the F2 population by PCR\nusing the primers for both AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1.\nHereafter, the AtrabD2b-2/AtrabD2c-1 double mutant\nwill be referred to as AtrabD2b/2c, and AtrabD2b-2 and\nAtrabD2c-1 single mutants will be referred to as\nAtrabD2b and AtrabD2c respectively.\nSiliques Are Shorter in the AtrabD2b/2c Double Mutant\nthan in Either Single Mutant or in Wild-Type Lines\nTo evaluate phenotypes associated with the AtrabD2b\nand AtrabD2c mutants, homozygous AtrabD2b (three\nalleles, AtrabD2b-1, AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2b-3),\nAtrabD2c and AtrabD2b/2c mutants, along with wild-\ntype siblings, were grown on agar plates with or without\nvarious hormone, nutrient and light treatments. We\ntested over 50 of the conditions described in the Gantlet\nwebsite (http://www.gantlet.org); however, no significant\nphenotypic differences were observed in the seedlings for\nany of the mutant alleles (data not shown). In addition,\nwe tested the seedling phenotype on media with or with-\nout sucrose or vitamin B5 and, consistent with previous\nreports [22], no obvious phenotypes were observed.\nBy contrast, AtrabD2b/2c double mutant lines\nshowed a phenotype associated with reproduction. In\nthese lines, siliques were shorter when grown either\nunder continuous light or long day (16h light/8h dark)\nconditions. Neither the AtrabD2b nor the AtrabD2c\nsingle mutant alleles displayed a short silique pheno-\ntype. The length of AtrabD2b/2c siliques was 70% of\nthat of wild-type, AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c single mutant\nlines (Figure 2; P < 0.01 by Student\u2019s t-test). To evalu-\nate whether this reduced silique size is associated with\na seed defect, siliques from AtrabD2b/2c, wild-type,\nAtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutant lines were opened at\n10 DAF (days after flowering). Consistently, no defects\nin the seeds of either AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c single\nmutants were observed. However, approximately half\nof the ovules in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were\nnot fertilized (Figure 3). Consistent with this observa-\ntion, the AtrabD2b/2c mutant plants produced a smal-\nler quantity of seeds than wild-type plants or single\nmutants (Figure 3; Additional file 2, Figure S1). These\nresults are consistent with a functional overlap\nbetween AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c that cannot be ful-\nfilled by AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a.\nComplementation of AtrabD2b/2c Mutant Phenotype\nTo demonstrate that the AtrabD2b/2c mutant phenotype\nis due to the mutations in the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c\ngenes, constructs containing either AtRabD2b or\nAtRabD2c, each expressed from their native promoter,\nwere introduced into the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant.\nAtRabD2c\n2060bp\nAtRabD2b\n2055bp\n100bp\nATG\nTAA\nATG\nTGA\nAtrabD2b-2\nAtrabD2b-1\nAtrabD2b-3\nAtrabD2c-1\nA\nM\nM\nB\nCol-0\nAtrabD2c\nAtrabD2b\nAtrabD2b/2c\nAtRabD2c\nAtRabD2b\nTubulin\nC\nCol-0\nAtrabD2c\nAtrabD2b\n1   2    3    4     1    2    3    4     1    2    3    4     1    2    3    4\nAtrabD2b/2c\n100bp\nFigure 1 Characterization of AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutations.\nA, Gene map.

One possibi-\nlity is that the pollen bears a defect that leads to pollen\nsterility and inability to fertilize the embryos. Alterna-\ntively, ovules may bear an abnormality such that their\nfertilization is reduced. To distinguish between these\ntwo possibilities, we observed the pollen by scanning\nelectron microscopy (SEM). All of the pollen from wild-\ntype plants looked normal, whereas more than 20% of\nthe AtrabD2b/2c pollen exhibited an irregular, collapsed\nmorphology (Figure 5A). We also observed that some\nabnormal pollen grains from the AtrabD2b/2c double\nmutant were devoid of nuclei, as indicated by DAPI\nstaining, whereas all pollen from wild-type (Figure 5B)\nand single mutant plants (data not shown) have nuclei.\nThis defective pollen may be the severely collapsed\npollen visualized under the SEM. Surprisingly, even the\nAtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutant lines produce\naberrant pollen at a level of about 10%. This is unex-\npected, as the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants\nhave normal-appearing siliques and seed quantities simi-\nlar to the wild-type plants. A likely explanation is that\nthere are sufficient normal pollen grains in the single\nmutants to efficiently fertilize the ovaries in the\nAtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants.\nWe originally identified AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c\nbecause the transcript accumulation patterns of these\ntwo genes correlate with those of many genes associated\nwith starch metabolism. Indeed, the AtrabD2b/2c double\nmutant pollen stained less intensely with IKI than wild-\ntype pollen (Figure 5C), suggesting a decreased starch\ncontent in the AtrabD2b/2c mutant pollen. This is con-\nsistent with the expression correlation, although the rea-\nson for this phenotype is unclear.\nA single flower of Arabidopsis produces thousands of\npollen grains, but usually there are less than 100\nembryos in one silique. If only 20% of the pollen grains\nare abnormal, we would not expect the strikingly\nreduced fertility seen in the AtrabD2b/2c double\nmutant. We therefore looked for additional explanations\nfor the reduced fertility. To evaluate germination and\nFigure 3 There are many non-fertilized ovaries in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant. Individual siliques of wild type, single and double\nmutant plants were dissected and examined under the microscope. Arrows heads indicate unfertilized ovaries.

After overnight incubation, almost all of the\npollen from wild-type plants germinated and showed a\ntypical tip growth. However, about 10% of the pollen\nfrom the AtrabD2b/2c mutant did not germinate at all\nand 50% of the pollen germinated but did not grow api-\ncally as did pollen of wild-type plants (Figure 6A and\n6B). Instead, these pollen tubes were shorter and had\nswollen tips, some burst (\u22485%), and others branched\n(\u22482%; Figure 6A,B and 6D). The germination rate of the\npollen from the single mutants was similar to the wild-\ntype pollen. However, approximately 20% of the germi-\nnating pollen also had swollen tips (Figure 6A and 6B),\nalthough the phenotype was not as severe as the\nAtrabD2b/2c double mutant; burst or branched tubes\nwere never observed in either single mutant (Figure 6A\nand 6B). Moreover, the pollen tubes of the AtrabD2b/2c\ndouble mutant were much shorter than those of wild-\ntype plants or either single mutant (P < 0.01), and the\nsingle mutants had shorter pollen tubes than wild-type\nplants (Figure 6E; P < 0.01 for both mutants). Even\nthough the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants had\ncollapsed pollen, shorter pollen tubes and swollen tips,\ntheir siliques were normal compared with wild-type\nplants. We hypothesize that the single mutants may still\nhave sufficient normal pollen to enable all embryos to\nbe fertilized. The in vitro pollen germination phenotypes\nwere confirmed by analyzing pollen tube growth after in\nvivo pollination (Figure 6C). Open flowers from wild-\ntype or AtrabD2b/2c mutant plants were incubated\novernight on agar medium. The AtrabD2b/2c mutant\nflowers had reduced pollen germination and decreased\npollen tube length compared with wild-type plants, sug-\ngesting that pollen germination and pollen tube growth\nmay also be defective in vivo.\nPollen and Pollen Tube Defects Cause the Shorter Siliques\nin the AtrabD2b/2c Mutant\nTo investigate whether the unfertilized seeds are due to\nthe observed pollen abnormality, or whether the ovary\nalso has defects that might contribute to the reduced\nrate of fertilization, we crossed wild-type and AtrabD2b/\n2c mutant plants. If the shorter silique phenotype is\nborne only by the abnormal pollen, wild-type plant pol-\nlen should rescue the AtrabD2b/2c mutant silique phe-\nnotype to a normal length (AtrabD2b/2c mutant female\nflower crossed with wild-type plant pollen). In contrast,\nthe AtrabD2b/2c mutant plant pollen crossed with a\nwild-type female would mimic the mutant phenotype of\ndecreased fertilization (wild-type female flower crossed\nwith AtrabD2b/2c mutant pollen). Alternatively, if the\novary also has some abnormality, wild-type pollen\nwould not completely rescue the mutant phenotype, and\nAtrabD2b/2c mutant pollen would not mimic the\nmutant phenotype. The results of these crosses indicated\nthat pollen from wild-type plants can rescue the\nAtrabD2b/2c short silique phenotype, and the pollen\nfrom AtrabD2b/2c can bestow the shorter silique phe-\nnotype on wild-type plants (Figures 7A and 7C). Specifi-\ncally, about half of the seeds were not fertilized in the\nsiliques that developed from wild-type pistils fertilized\nby AtrabD2b/2c pollen (Figure 7B). In contrast, the sili-\nques from AtrabD2b/2c usually had about 50% unferti-\nlized ovules, but when these pistils were fertilized by\nwild-type pollen, all seeds looked normal, and the sili-\nques were longer than those siliques in the same inflor-\nescence which were self-fertilized (Figures 7). These\nresults confirm that the unfertilized ovaries are mostly,\nif not exclusively, caused by pollen defects in the\nAtrabD2b/2c mutant.\nFigure 4 Complementation of the double mutant phenotype.\nA, Siliques are shown from wild-type plants, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c\nsingle mutants, the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant and the AtrabD2b/\n2c double mutant complemented with either AtRabD2b or\nAtRabD2c.

Interestingly, in emerging leaves, AtRabD2c was\nonly expressed in the trichomes, while AtRabD2b was\nnot expressed in these cells (Figure 9A). In flowers,\nAtRabD2b was expressed in sepals, stamen and stigma,\nwhile AtRabD2c was expressed in sepal, stamen, stigma\nand style (Figure 9E, F). This dichotomy of expression\nsuggests that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c may function\nindependently of each other in certain cells.

BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:25\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/25\nPage 11 of 16\nAtRabD2c will share this localization. To determine the\nsubcellular localization of AtRabD2c, GFP-AtRabD2b\nand GFP-AtRabD2c constructs were introduced into\nArabidopsis leaf protoplasts and the GFP signal was\nobserved by confocal microscopy. For both constructs,\nGFP localized to punctuate structures, reminiscent of the\nGolgi apparatus. To verify the identity of these structures,\nGFP-AtRabD2b and GFP-AtRabD2c were co-transfected\ninto Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts with the trans-Golgi\nmarker ST-YFP [15], and YFP and GFP signals were\nobserved. Confocal results indicated that both AtRabD2b\nand AtRabD2c primarily colocalized with ST-YFP (Figure\n10) and are therefore associated with the Golgi, consis-\ntent with a role in Golgi trafficking. Occasionally,\nAtRabD2b or AtRabD2c-labeled structures were seen\nthat did not contain ST-YFP; these could be the post-\nGolgi compartments described previously [22,23,27].\nCells expressing a single GFP or YFP fusion demon-\nstrated the absence of cross talk between GFP and YFP\nsignals (Additional file 3, Figure S2).\nDiscussion\nRab GTPases are critical players in the transport of materi-\nals through the endomembrane system, controlling exocy-\ntosis of proteins and cell wall materials, endocytosis of\nreceptors and transporters, and membrane recycling pro-\ncesses. Together with SNARE proteins, they promote spe-\ncificity of vesicle transport to target compartments,\nensuring that vesicles fuse only with their appropriate tar-\nget and thus maintaining the distinct identity of individual\norganelles. Two Rab subfamilies, Rab1 (AtRabD orthologs)\nand Rab2 (AtRabB orthologs), have been reported to func-\ntion in membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi in\nmammalian cells [21,28-34]. The plant Rab1 and Rab2\nhomologs AtRabD1, AtRabD2a and NtRab2 have also\nbeen reported to function in ER to Golgi vesicle transport\n[15,16]. Here, we demonstrate a distinct physiological role\nfor the Rab1 homologs AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in pollen\ndevelopment and pollen tube growth.\nUsing the bioinformatics tool MetaOmGraph (http://\nwww.metnetdb.org) [25,26] to determine the pairwise\nPearsons correlation value between the expression pat-\nterns of all of the 57 AtRab genes (Additional file 1,\nTable S1), we found that among the four AtRabDs, only\nthe expression of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are highly\ncorrelated. From this data, we hypothesized that\nAtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have partially redundant func-\ntions that are not shared by the remaining AtRabD\nfamily members. To test our hypothesis, we used T-\nDNA insertion single and double mutants to confirm\nthat AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have functional overlap\nand show that they are both required for normal pollen\ndevelopment and tip growth of pollen tubes. We also\nshowed that they both co-localize with the trans-Golgi\nmarker ST-YFP, consistent with their proposed role in\nGolgi trafficking.\nThe conclusion that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are\npartially functionally redundant is based on several lines\nof evidence. First, although single mutant plants con-\ntaining AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c mutant alleles are indis-\ntinguishable morphologically from their wild-type\ncounterparts, even when grown under a variety of\nFigure 10 AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are both Golgi resident proteins. Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts were co-transformed with GFP-AtRabD2b\nor GFP-AtRabD2c and the Golgi marker ST-YFP. GFP, YFP and chlorophyll autofluorescence were detected by confocal microcopy. At least 10\ntransformed protoplasts were observed for each construct. Upper panel, GFP-AtRabD2b; lower panel, GFP-AtRabD2c. Scale bar = 10 \u03bcm.\nPeng et al.

Second, both AtrabD2b and\nAtrabD2c mutant plants produce a small percentage of\ndeformed and collapsed pollen grains, while AtrabD2b/\n2c lines produce a higher percentage of deformed pollen\ngrains, many of which are severely deformed, some lack-\ning nuclei. It is probable that such aberrant pollen\nwould give rise to defects in pollen germination, and\nindeed, though the germination rate is similar between\nAtrabD2b or AtrabD2c single mutants and wild-type\nplants, about 10% of the pollen grains from AtrabD2b/\n2c double mutant plants are unable to geminate.\nFurthermore, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutant pollen\ntubes do not grow apically as well as do wild-type pollen\ntubes and tend to have swollen tips and a shorter\nlength; this phenotype is substantially more severe in\nAtrabD2b/2c double mutants. In addition, some pollen\ntubes from AtrabD2b/2c double mutants branch or\nburst, which is not seen in pollen tubes of wild-type\nplants or either single mutant. These data also indicate\nthat the loss of function of the AtRabD2b/2c genes can-\nnot be compensated for by the AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a\ngenes, suggesting that either some function(s) of the\nAtRabD2b and AtRabD2c proteins are distinct from\nthose of AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a, or that they are not\nexpressed in the same cell types.\nBoth AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c co-localize with the\nGolgi marker ST-YFP upon transient expression in Ara-\nbidopsis leaf protoplasts, as was reported also for\nAtRabD2a (formerly called AtRab1b) [15]. It is therefore\npossible that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c function in vesi-\ncle trafficking between the ER and Golgi apparatus, as\ndoes AtRabD2a [15,22]. Complete disruption of Rab\nfunction in ER-to-Golgi trafficking is expected to be\nlethal, due to loss of plasma membrane, vacuole and cell\nwall assembly and integrity. However, the AtrabD2b/2c\ndouble mutant is indistinguishable from wild-type plants,\nexcept for shorter siliques due to the pollen and pollen\ntube defects. There are several possible explanations for\nthis. First, other AtRabs must perform the same function\nin vegetative tissue. The most likely candidates are\nAtRabD2a and AtRabD1, which could compensate for\nthe loss of function in the AtrabD2b/2c mutant in most\ncell types [22]. Moreover, other Rab families, such as\ntobacco RabBs (NtRab2s) have also been shown to be\nregulators of membrane trafficking between the ER and\nGolgi apparatus [16]. AtRabBs (AtRab2s) may have the\nsame function, such that they also participate in ER to\nGolgi vesicle trafficking. The pattern of AtRabB1b RNA\naccumulation is most highly correlated with that of\nAtRabD2b (67%) and AtRabD2c (68%) (Additional file 1,\nTable S1). These genes might compensate in part for the\nloss of function of AtrabD2b/2c.\nSecond, pollen tubes grow very rapidly compared with\nmany other cell types. Pollen tubes elongate by tip\ngrowth, whereby the pollen cytoplasm is confined to the\nmost proximal region of the tube, and growth is\nrestricted to the tube apex [35]. In vitro, lily pollen\ntubes grow at about 150 nm/sec [35] and Arabidopsis\npollen tubes at 37 nm/sec [36]; in vivo, tobacco pollen\ncan grow at 42 nm/sec [37]. This fast growth is contin-\ngent on rapid vesicle trafficking to deliver large amounts\nof membrane and cell wall components to the apical\nregion of the tubes. This extensive trafficking require-\nment may preclude the remaining Rabs from completely\ncompensating for loss of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c.\nThird, computational analysis of public microarray\ndata, together with studies of the expression pattern\ndirected by the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c promoters,\nindicated that both are widely expressed in most organs\nand several cell types, with high expression in pollen.\nRoot hairs also showed expression of AtRabD2b, and,\nlike pollen tubes, root hairs elongate by tip growth.\nHowever, root hair growth in the AtrabD2b/2c double\nmutant is indistinguishable from that of wild-type\nplants. This is consistent with the idea that AtRabD2b\nand AtRabD2c are required for vesicle trafficking in\nmultiple cell types, and that the highest demand for this\nprocess may be in pollen and pollen tubes, in order to\noptimally support the large secretory requirement of\nthese very rapidly elongating cells. In combination, these\ndata indicate that the high expression of AtRabD2b and\nAtRabD2c in pollen may be important to facilitate\nmembrane trafficking needed for pollen tube growth.\nConclusions\nIn summary, we used a T-DNA insertion mutant\napproach to demonstrate the function of AtRabD2b and\nAtRabD2c. Our data indicated that both are Golgi resi-\ndents; they have similar but not identical expression\npatterns, but are both highly expressed in pollen; they\nare both involved in tip growth of pollen tubes; and\nthey are at least partially functionally redundant. Future\nwork will focus on elucidating the molecular basis for\nthe pollen phenotype in the AtrabD2b/2c double\nmutant.\nMethods\nPlant Materials and Growth Conditions\nWild-type Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ecotype\nColumbia\n(Col-0),\nAtrabD2c-1,\nAtrabD2b-1\nand\nAtrabD2b/2c (crosses of AtrabD2b-1 and AtrabD2c-1)\nmutants in the same genetic background were used.\nSeeds were sown in Sunshine Soil mix, incubated at 4\u00b0C\nfor 2 to 3 days, then grown at 22\u00b0C, 70% relative humid-\nity, in a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod [26].\nPeng et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:25\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/25\nPage 13 of 16\nScreening for T-DNA insertion mutants\nT-DNA insertion mutants of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c\n(Salk_045030 (AtrabD2b-1), Salk_117532 (AtrabD2b-2)\nand\nSalk_120116\n(AtrabD2b-3)\nfor\nAtrabD2b;\nSalk_054626 (AtrabD2c-3) for AtrabD2c) were obtained\nfrom ABRC [38]. Homozygous lines for T-DNA inser-\ntions were identified by PCR genotyping. For each\nT-DNA insertion mutant, two sets of PCRs were per-\nformed using genomic DNA as a template: one with a\ngene-specific primer and a T-DNA left border primer\nLBb1, the second with two gene-specific primers. The\nPCR products were sequenced to confirm the locations\nof the T-DNA insertion sites for all of the mutants. The\ngene specific primers used are listed in Table 2.\nCrossing and screening for double mutant\nSingle mutant alleles (AtrabD2b-1 and AtrabD2c-1;\nFigure 1A) were crossed, the F1 generation of these\ncrosses was allowed to self fertilization and the\nAtrabD2b/2c double mutant was identified from the F2\ngeneration by PCR genotyping.\nSemi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR\nTotal RNA was extracted from leaves of 20 DAI (days\nafter imbibition) plants using the TRIZOL reagent\n(Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using Super-\nScript\u2122III One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen,) as\nper the manufacturer\u2019s manual. The b-tubulin gene,\nwhich is highly conserved and constitutively expressed\nin all eukaryotes, was used as a standard. The primers\nused are listed in Table 2. The RT-PCR products were\nsequenced to confirm the correct amplification\nproduct.\nIn vitro pollen germination and growth measurement\nPollen was obtained from flowers collected from Arabi-\ndopsis plants (ten plant lines per genotype) 1 to 2 weeks\nafter bolting. Pollen from AtrabD2b/2c, AtrabD2b and\nAtrabD2c mutants, along with pollen from wild-type\nplants, was germinated on agar medium containing 18%\n(w/v) sucrose, 0.01% (w/v) boric acid, 1mM MgSO4,\n1mM CaCl2, 1mM Ca(NO3)2, and 0.5% (w/v) agar, pH\n7.0 [39] overnight at room temperature and examined\nand photographed under a Zeiss Axioplan II compound\nmicroscope equipped with an AxioCam color digital\ncamera. Measurements were performed using SIS Pro\nsoftware (OSIS, Lakewood, CO) using the bars in the ori-\nginal image. For pollen tube length measurements, 200\npollen tubes were chosen randomly for each genotype,\nand significance was assessed using Student\u2019s t-test.\nFor fluorescence microscopy, the germinated pollen\nwas transferred onto a slide and two drops of aniline\nblue solution (0.005% aniline blue solution in 0.1 M\nsodium phosphate, pH 7.0) were added for ten minutes.\nTo confirm the pollen tube growth defects, 20 open\nflowers per genotype were cut below the pistil and inserted\nvertically into germination medium in a 9-cm Petri dish.\nPlates were sealed and incubated overnight at 22\u00b0C at\n100% humidity under continuous illumination. The paths\nof pollen tubes inside the pistils were visualized by fixing\nwhole pistils in 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformalde-\nhyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, under\nlow vacuum (18 psi Hg) for 2 h at room temperature.\nSamples were washed three times in the same buffer and\nstained with Aniline Blue and DAPI. The tissue was then\ncleared for 24 hours at room temperature with a drop of\nclearing solution (240 g of chloral hydrate and 30 g of gly-\ncerol in 90 ml water). Pollen was examined with a Zeiss\nAxioplan 2 light microscope (LM) and images were cap-\ntured with a Zeiss AxioCamHRc digital camera (Carl\nZeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) using AxioVision 4.3 soft-\nware. The microscope was equipped with a DAPI filter set\ncomprising an excitation filter (BP 365/12 nm), a beam\nsplitter (395 nm), and an emission filter (LP 397 nm). The\nobjectives used for imaging were a Neofluar 40\u00d7 oil, an\nApochromat 63\u00d7 oil, and a Neofluar 100\u00d7 oil.\nCloning\nPromoter::GFP/GUS fusion constructs were made for\neach gene by cloning the amplified promoter region\n(intergenic region; 964 bp for AtRabD2b and 558 bp for\nAtRabD2c) into the binary vector pBGWFS7 (GATE-\nWAY; Invitrogen).\nThe genomic fragments containing AtRabD2b or\nAtRabD2c with their respective promoters for comple-\nmentation of the mutant phenotype were amplified\nusing AtRabD2b-g-F and R or AtRabD2c-g-F and R pri-\nmers (Table 2).

Plants or organs\nwere stained at room temperature overnight as described\n[41], then destained in 70% (v/v) ethanol. For each con-\nstruct, at least 7 independently transformed lines, 7 plants\nfor each stage, were harvested for GUS screening.\nTransient expression in protoplasts\nTransient gene expression in Arabidopsis mesophyll\nprotoplasts was carried out as described previously [42].\nIn brief, Arabidopsis protoplasts were isolated from the\nleaves of 3-4 week old plants. Leaf strips were digested\nin a buffer containing cellulose R-10 and macerozyme\nR-10. After adding 30 \u03bcg of plasmid DNA, an equal\nvolume of protoplasts was mixed with PEG buffer (40%\n(w/v) PEG4000, 25% (v/v) 0.8M mannitol, 10% 1M\nCaCl2) then incubated at room temperature for 25 min.\nAfter gentle washing, the protoplasts were kept in the\ndark at room temperature overnight and then viewed by\nconfocal laser scanning microscopy as described below.\nConfocal laser scanning microscopy\nColocalization of GFP-RabD2b and GFP-RabD2c with\nST-YFP was performed using a Leica TCS SP10 confo-\ncal microscope, which allows flexible selection of emis-\nsion\nbandwidths\nto\nminimize\nbleed-through.\nTransformed cells were excited with a 488 nm laser\n(power 20%) and 514 nm laser (50% power), and GFP\nand YFP signals were collected using 495-510 nm and\n560-640 nm bandwidths, respectively. Non-transformed\ncells and cells expressing a single GFP or YFP fusion\nwere used as controls to confirm the absence of cross\ntalk between GFP, YFP and autofluorescence signals.\nScanning electron microscopy\nPollen that had been germinated in vitro was placed in\n2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M\nsodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, under low vacuum\n(18 psi Hg) for 5 h at room temperature. Samples were\nwashed three times in the same buffer, postfixed in 1%\nosmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 2 h and washed\ntwo times in the same buffer, followed by deionized\nwater. Samples were dehydrated through a graded etha-\nnol series (50, 70, 85, 95, and 100%; 30 min per step),\nfollowed by two changes of ultrapure 100% ethanol, all\n30 min per step. Fresh pollen was also examined with-\nout fixing. Fixed samples were critical point-dried in a\nDCP-1 Denton critical-point-drying apparatus (http://\nwww.dentonvacuum.com) using liquid carbon dioxide,\nand mounted on aluminum stubs with double-sided\nsticky pads and silver cement.\nSamples were then sputter-coated with 15 nm gold\n(20%) and palladium (80%) in a Denton Vacuum LLC\nDesk II Cold Sputter Unit (http://www.dentonvacuum.\ncom), and viewed with a JEOL 5800LV SEM (http://www.\njeol.com) at 10 kV. Alternatively, released fresh pollen\ngrains were directly mounted on stubs and sputter-coated\nwith gold particles before SEM analysis. All digitally col-\nlected images including the LM and SEM images were\nprocessed in Adobe PhotoShop 7.0 and made into plates\nusing Adobe Illustrator 10. Over 20 samples from each\nplant line were used for SEM or LM analysis.\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1: Table S1.

    "full_text": "TNO1 Is Involved in Salt Tolerance and Vacuolar\nTraf\ufb01cking in Arabidopsis1[W][OA]\nSang-Jin Kim2 and Diane C. Bassham*\nDepartment of Genetics, Development, and Cell Biology (S.-J.K., D.C.B.), Plant Sciences Institute (D.C.B.), and\nInterdepartmental Genetics Program (S.-J.K., D.C.B.), Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa 50011\nThe Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor SYP41 is involved\nin vesicle fusion at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and interacts with AtVPS45, SYP61, and VTI12. These proteins are involved\nin diverse cellular processes, including vacuole biogenesis and stress tolerance. A previously uncharacterized protein, named\nTNO1 (for TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), was identi\ufb01ed by coimmunoprecipitation as a SYP41-interacting protein.\nTNO1 was found to localize to the TGN by immuno\ufb02uorescence microscopy. A tno1 mutant showed increased sensitivity to\nhigh concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl and also to mannitol-induced osmotic stress. Localization of SYP61, which is\ninvolved in the salt stress response, was disrupted in the tno1 mutant. Vacuolar proteins were partially secreted to the apoplast\nin the tno1 mutant, suggesting that TNO1 is required for ef\ufb01cient protein traf\ufb01cking to the vacuole. The tno1 mutant had\ndelayed formation of the brefeldin A (BFA) compartment in cotyledons upon application of BFA, suggesting less ef\ufb01cient\nmembrane fusion processes in the mutant. Unlike most TGN proteins, TNO1 does not relocate to the BFA compartment upon\nBFA treatment. These data demonstrate that TNO1 is involved in vacuolar traf\ufb01cking and salt tolerance, potentially via roles in\nvesicle fusion and in maintaining TGN structure or identity.\nThe plant vacuole is a versatile organelle that has\nimportant functions, including maintaining turgor, ion\nhomeostasis, compartmentalizing toxic material, accu-\nmulating defense compounds, and storing and degrad-\ning proteins (Marty, 1999). To maintain these functions,\ncorrect transport of vacuolar proteins is required. Vac-\nuolar proteins are synthesized at the endoplasmic re-\nticulum (ER) and are transported cotranslationally into\nthe ER lumen. From the ER, they are transported to the\ntrans-Golgi network (TGN) via the Golgi (To\u00a8rma\u00a8kangas\net al., 2001). In the TGN, vacuolar proteins with sequence-\nspeci\ufb01c vacuolar sorting determinants are thought to\nbe recognized by vacuolar sorting receptors (VSRs;\nKirsch et al., 1994; Ahmed et al., 2000; daSilva et al.,\n2005), although a recent report has suggested that\nrecognition of cargo by VSRs may occur as early as\nthe ER (Niemes et al., 2010). Storage proteins with\nC-terminal sorting sequences are also bound by VSRs\nor by a second putative sorting receptor, RMR1 (Jiang\net al., 2000; Shimada et al., 2003a; Park et al., 2005, 2007;\nHinz et al., 2007). After the receptors recognize their\ncargo, vacuolar proteins are transported to the pre-\nvacuolar compartment (PVC; Sanderfoot et al., 1998;\nHappel et al., 2004; Song et al., 2006) before transport\non to the vacuole. In mammalian cells, cargo receptors\nare recycled from their destination to the site of cargo\nbinding (Seaman, 2005). VSR1 was found to localize to\nthe TGN and the PVC (Paris et al., 1997; Sanderfoot\net al., 1998); thus, VSR1 was also suggested to cycle\nbetween these organelles.\nSoluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attach-\nment protein receptors (SNAREs) are integral mem-\nbrane proteins required for the fusion of vesicles with\ntheir target membrane. SNAREs can be classi\ufb01ed based\non their site of function: v (vesicle)-SNAREs are local-\nized to the vesicle membrane, and t (target)-SNAREs\nare localized to the target membrane (Rothman, 1994;\nS\u00f8gaard et al., 1994). Generally, one v-SNARE on the\nvesicle and three t-SNAREs on the target membrane\nform a trans-SNARE complex, bringing the two mem-\nbranes in contact and driving membrane fusion (McNew\net al., 2000). Clathrin-coated vesicles containing VSR1\ncontain the v-SNARE VTI11, which forms a SNARE\ncomplex with SYP5, SYP2, and VAMP727 at the PVC\nduring anterograde traf\ufb01cking from the TGN (Kirsch\net al., 1994; Sanderfoot et al., 2001a; Ebine et al., 2008).\nHowever, the mechanism of recycling of VSR1 from\nthe PVC to the TGN is not yet fully understood. A\ncomplex containing the SNAREs SYP41, SYP61, and\nVTI12 and the Sec1/Munc18-like protein AtVPS45, a\npotential regulator of vesicle fusion (Dulubova et al.,\n2002; Bryant and James, 2003), is found at the TGN\nin Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; Bassham and\nRaikhel, 1998; Bassham et al., 2000).

Recently, AtVPS45 was\nsuggested to be involved in the recycling of VSR1, as\nRNA interference knockdown of AtVPS45 expression\ncauses mislocalization of VSR1 (Zouhar et al., 2009).\nSYP41 and SYP42 are highly homologous t-SNAREs\nwith 62% amino acid sequence identity. However,\nthey form separate complexes with AtVPS45 in dif-\nferent subdomains of the TGN (Bassham et al., 2000)\nand are not functionally redundant, as individual syp41\nand syp42 knockout mutants are gametophytic lethal\n(Sanderfoot et al., 2001b). A mutation in SYP61, another\nt-SNARE in the SYP41 complex (Zhu et al., 2002),\ncaused defects in osmotic stress tolerance and abscisic\nacid regulation of stomatal responses. The v-SNARE\nVTI12 is involved in traf\ufb01cking of storage proteins\n(Sanmart\u0131\u00b4n et al., 2007) and a vti12 mutant showed an\nearly-senescence phenotype under starvation condi-\ntions, suggesting that VTI12 is also involved in the\nautophagy pathway for the degradation of cellular con-\ntents (Surpin et al., 2003). In addition to their function\ntogether in vesicle fusion, components of the SYP41\ncomplex therefore also appear to be involved in distinct\nprocesses, suggesting that they may function in addi-\ntional SNARE complexes.\nIn this study, we identi\ufb01ed a novel SYP41-interact-\ning protein that we named TNO1 (for TGN-localized\nSYP41-interacting protein). TNO1 is a membrane pro-\ntein at the TGN and is required for ef\ufb01cient vacuolar\ntraf\ufb01cking, consistent with the hypothesis that it func-\ntions together with the SYP41 SNARE complex. A tno1\nknockout mutant has a salt and osmotic stress-sensitive\nphenotype, possibly due to the partial mislocalization\nof SYP61. A brefeldin A (BFA)-treated tno1 mutant\nshowed a delay in formation of the BFA compartment,\nindicating that TNO1 could be important in TGN/\nendosome fusion events. We propose that TNO1 is\ninvolved in vacuolar traf\ufb01cking and salt stress resis-\ntance by facilitating the vesicle fusion process.\nRESULTS\nIdenti\ufb01cation of TNO1\nSYP41 is a t-SNARE at the TGN that is required for\nvesicle fusion in Arabidopsis and forms a complex with\nVTI12, SYP61, and AtVPS45 (Bassham and Raikhel,\n2000; Chen et al., 2005). To identify additional SYP41-\ninteracting proteins, detergent-solubilized membrane\nextracts of Arabidopsis suspension cells were immu-\nnoprecipitated using SYP41 antibody. Proteins that\ncoimmunoprecipitated with SYP41, or with preimmune\nantibody as a control, were separated by SDS-PAGE\nand visualized by silver staining. Four bands corre-\nsponding to proteins migrating at approximately 200,\n67, 35, and 15 kD were found only in the SYP41\nprecipitate and were not present in the SYP41 preim-\nmune precipitate, suggesting that they speci\ufb01cally in-\nteracted with SYP41 (Fig. 1A).\nThe 200-, 67-, 35-, and 15-kD bands were analyzed by\ntandem mass spectrometry, comparing the fragmenta-\ntion patterns with the predicted Arabidopsis proteome.\nThe 67- and 15-kD bands were identi\ufb01ed as AtVPS45\nand a degradation product of SYP61, respectively\n(Sanderfoot et al., 2001a). The 35-kD band contained\nSYP41, SYP42, and also SYP43, an additional protein in\nthe SYP4 family that has not yet been characterized.\nNine peptides from the 200-kD band (Supplemental\nFig. S1B, blue bars) could be matched to the predicted\nprotein encoded by At1g24460, corresponding to 5.2%\namino acid coverage, and the protein was named TNO1.\nA cDNA corresponding to the open reading frame of\nTNO1 was obtained by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR.\nA comparison of the sequence of this cDNA with the\nsequence in The Arabidopsis Information Resource re-\nvealed the presence of an additional 63 bp (from 4,190 to\n4,252; Supplemental Fig. S1A), suggesting the presence\nof an extra exon in our TNO1 sequence (Supplemental\nFig. S1B, red bar) and that either the predicted sequence\nin The Arabidopsis Information Resource has incorrectly\npredicted splice sites or multiple splice variants exist.\nTNO1, a previously uncharacterized protein of predicted\nmass 209 kD, was predicted to have six coiled-coil\ndomains in the Arabi-Coil database (Rose et al., 2004)\nbased on the MultiCoil algorithm (Wolf et al., 1997) and\nFigure 1.

TNO1 was detected in the SYP41 precipitate\nbut not in the preimmune precipitate, con\ufb01rming the\ncorrect identi\ufb01cation of the 200-kD band (Fig. 1B).\nTo investigate the expression pattern of TNO1, RT-PCR\nwas performed using RNA extracted from different\nArabidopsis plant organs. TNO1 was ubiquitously ex-\npressed in roots, rosette leaves, cauline leaves, and\n\ufb02owers, with lower expression in stems. SYP41 also\nshowed highest expression in \ufb02owers and lowest\nexpression in stems (Fig. 1C). Expression of TNO1 in\nArabidopsis plant organs and throughout develop-\nment was also analyzed using Genevestigator, a data-\nbase and Web browser data-mining interface for\nAffymetrix GeneChip data (Hruz et al., 2008). The\nbroad expression pattern observed was consistent\nwith the RT-PCR results, with TNO1 found to be\nhighly expressed during germination, \ufb02ower develop-\nment, and silique maturation (Supplemental Fig. S3).\nThis expression pattern suggests that TNO1 may have\nan important role throughout the plant, particularly\nduring reproductive stages.\nTNO1 Is a TGN-Localized Membrane Protein\nTo study the function of TNO1, an antibody was\nraised against a 66-kD fragment from the C terminus of\nTNO1. The speci\ufb01city of af\ufb01nity-puri\ufb01ed TNO1 anti-\nbody was tested by immunoblotting against total cell\nextract, total membrane, and total soluble proteins from\n2-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings. Puri\ufb01ed TNO1 an-\ntibody speci\ufb01cally recognized a band of approximately\n200 kD in Arabidopsis extracts (Fig. 2A) that was not\ndetected by the preimmune serum (Fig. 2B).\nTo investigate the potential membrane association of\nTNO1, the presence of TNO1 in membrane fractions\nwas analyzed. An Arabidopsis suspension cell extract\nwas centrifuged sequentially at 20,000g and 100,000g,\nproducing three different fractions, P20 (pellet at\n20,000g), P100 (pellet at 100,000g), and S (supernatant\nfrom 100,000g). These fractions were analyzed by\nimmunoblotting using TNO1 and SYP61 antibodies.\nThe integral membrane protein SYP61 was detected\nstrongly in all membrane fractions and was not present\nin the soluble fraction. TNO1 was also present in all the\nmembrane fractions but not in the soluble fraction,\nsuggesting that TNO1 is associated with membranes\n(Fig. 2C). The band present above the TNO1 band in the\nP20 fraction corresponds to the top of the gel, where\noccasionally some aggregated protein is seen.\nTo determine the mode of association of TNO1 with\nmembranes, total membrane fractions were isolated\nfrom 2-week-old seedlings and treated with 1% (v/v)\nTriton X-100, 2 M urea, 1 M NaCl, or 0.1 M Na2CO3,\nfollowed by repelleting of nonsolubilized proteins.\nImmunoblotting using TNO1 and SYP41 antibodies\nindicated that SYP41, an integral membrane protein\ncontrol, was solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 and that\nTNO1 was solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 and par-\ntially by 2 M urea (Fig. 2D) but not by 1 M NaCl or 0.1 M\nNa2CO3. This suggests that TNO1 is a membrane-\nintegrated protein, consistent with the transmem-\nbrane domain prediction of a C-terminal membrane\nanchor.\nTo analyze TNO1 subcellular localization, immuno-\n\ufb02uorescence microscopy was performed and TNO1\nlabeling compared with that of known markers. Coty-\nledons of wild-type and tno1 mutant seedlings (see\nbelow) were immunolabeled using puri\ufb01ed TNO1 an-\ntibody to con\ufb01rm the speci\ufb01city of TNO1 labeling. In\nwild-type seedlings, TNO1 antibody labeled endoge-\nnous TNO1 in punctate structures, while no speci\ufb01c\nsignal was observed in the cotyledons of tno1 mutant\nseedlings (Fig. 3A), con\ufb01rming the speci\ufb01city of the\nantibody. In addition, omission of the \ufb01rst antibody,\nsecond antibody, and both \ufb01rst and second antibodies\nwas tested as controls for nonspeci\ufb01c staining or cross-\ntalk between different \ufb02uorescence channels. No spe-\nci\ufb01c \ufb02uorescence was observed in any of the controls\n(data not shown).\nPuri\ufb01ed TNO1 antibody was then used to label en-\ndogenous TNO1 in VHAa1-GFP (Dettmer et al., 2006),\ntruncated ST-GFP (Boevink et al., 1998), or RHA1-yellow\n\ufb02uorescent protein (YFP; Preuss et al., 2004) transgenic\nArabidopsis seedlings, which label TGN, Golgi, and\nPVC, respectively. VHAa1-GFP, RHA1-YFP, and ST-GFP\nall exhibited a dot-like pattern in cotyledons, and TNO1-\nFigure 2. Membrane association of TNO1. A and B, Detection of\nTNO1 using TNO1 antibody.

Suspensions were recentrifuged at 125,000g to separate\nsolubilized fractions (S) and insoluble fractions (P), which were ana-\nlyzed by immunoblotting using TNO1 and SYP41 antibodies.\nKim and Bassham\n516\nPlant Physiol. Vol. 156, 2011\nlabeled structures completely overlapped with VHAa1-\nlabeled structures but were distinct from those labeled\nwith ST-GFP or RHA1-YFP (Fig. 3, B\u2013D). This result\nindicates that TNO1 localizes to the TGN.\nIdenti\ufb01cation of the tno1 Knockout Mutant\nTo analyze the function of TNO1, we obtained a\nknockout mutant containing a T-DNA insertion in the\nTNO1 gene. A homozygous mutant was identi\ufb01ed by\nPCR of genomic DNA using TNO1 gene-speci\ufb01c\nprimers (LP and RP) and a T-DNA left border primer\n(LBa1) in three combinations (Fig. 4A). A 900-bp\nfragment corresponding to the intact TNO1 gene could\nbe ampli\ufb01ed from genomic DNA of wild-type plants\nusing LP and RP primers. This band was absent from\nthe tno1 mutant due to gene disruption by the T-DNA.\nPCR using LBa1 and LP or RP primers generated 450-\nbp bands, showing the existence of a T-DNA insertion\nin the tno1 mutant. This indicates that the tno1 mutant\nhas a complex insertion in its third exon, as T-DNA\nleft border sequences are present at both ends of\nthe insertion (Fig. 4, A and B). Lack of TNO1 protein\nexpression was con\ufb01rmed by immunoblotting of total\nprotein extracts from wild-type and tno1 mutant\nplants using af\ufb01nity-puri\ufb01ed TNO1 antibodies (Fig.\n4C). No difference in overall morphology or develop-\nment was seen between tno1 mutant and wild-type\nplants grown in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium\nor soil throughout their life cycle.\ntno1 Mutant Plants Are Sensitive to Salt and\nOsmotic Stress\nSYP61/OSM1, a t-SNARE in the SYP41 complex, has\nbeen reported to be involved in general salt/osmotic\nstress responses (Zhu et al., 2002). As TNO1 also\ninteracts with SYP41, TNO1 was hypothesized to be\ninvolved in similar stress responses. Therefore, the\nsensitivity of homozygous tno1 mutant plants to salt,\nionic, and osmotic stresses was tested. Wild-type and\ntno1 mutant seedlings were grown on MS solid me-\ndium for 5 d and transferred to MS solid medium\ncontaining 130 mM NaCl (Fig. 5, C and G), 140 mM KCl\n(Fig. 5, D and H), 17 mM LiCl (Fig. 5, E and I), or 300\nmM mannitol (Fig. 5, F and J), and root length was\nmeasured after 4 and 8 d. Under normal growth\nconditions, tno1 and wild-type seedlings were indis-\ntinguishable (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, tno1 mutant\nseedlings exhibited shorter roots and earlier leaf chlo-\nrosis than wild-type seedlings under Na+, K+, Li+,\nand nonionic osmotic stresses. This result shows that\nlack of TNO1 causes sensitivity to salt and osmotic\nstresses.\nTo con\ufb01rm that the observed phenotype of the\ntno1 mutant is due to disruption of the TNO1 gene, a\nFigure 3.

Vol. 156, 2011\n517\ngenomic fragment of TNO1 including the native pro-\nmoter was introduced into the tno1 mutant. TNO1\nexpression was restored to approximately wild-type\nlevels in the tno1/TNO1 promoter::TNO1 lines as de-\ntermined by immunoblotting using TNO1 antibody\n(Fig. 4D). This TNO1 genomic fragment complemented\nthe salt-, ionic-, and osmotic-sensitive phenotype of the\ntno1 mutant (Fig. 5).\nTo test whether the expression of salt or osmotic\nstress-responsive genes was altered in the tno1 mutant,\nexpression of TNO1, SYP61, and known salt (SALT\nOVERLY SENSITIVE1 [SOS1]) or osmotic (RD29 and\nDRE-BINDING PROTEIN [DREB2A]) stress-respon-\nsive genes was analyzed by RT-PCR. TNO1 was ex-\npressed at a basal level in the nontreated condition,\nand its mRNA level increased slightly during NaCl\nand KCl treatment, while no expression of TNO1 was\ndetected in the tno1 mutant, as expected (Supplemen-\ntal Fig. S4). An increase in the transcript level of SYP61\nwas observed in both wild-type and tno1 mutant plants\nin all stress conditions. SOS1, DREB2A, and RD29 in-\ncreased as expected (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki,\n1993b; Liu et al., 1998; Qiu et al., 2004), and no dif-\nference between wild-type and tno1 mutant plants was\nobserved (Supplemental Fig. S4). This result suggests\nthat the phenotype of the tno1 mutant is not caused by\ndisruption of the expression of genes involved in salt\nor osmotic stress responses.\nSYP61 Is Partially Mislocalized in the tno1 Mutant\nTNO1 interacts with the SYP41 complex, and the\ntno1 mutant has a phenotype similar to that of the\nsyp61 mutant. Thus, we hypothesized that a mutation\nin TNO1 may affect components of the SYP41 com-\nplex. The localization of SYP61 and SYP41 was inves-\ntigated in wild-type and tno1 mutant protoplasts.\nPreviously, SYP61 has been shown to colocalize with\nVHAa1-GFP (Dettmer et al., 2006). To investigate the\nlocalization of SYP61 in the tno1 mutant, a VHAa1-GFP\ntransgenic tno1 mutant was generated. Immuno\ufb02uores-\ncence analysis was performed using protoplasts gener-\nated from VHAa1-GFP transgenic wild-type and tno1\nmutant plants, and the percentage colocalization (SYP61-\nlabeled\nstructures\noverlapping\nwith\nVHAa1/total\nSYP61-labeled structures) was analyzed in ImageJ\n(Abramoff et al., 2004) using the colocalization \ufb01nder\nplugin. In wild-type protoplasts, 70% of SYP61 colo-\ncalized with VHAa1-GFP, while 47% of SYP61 was\nfound to colocalize with VHAa1-GFP in the tno1\nmutant protoplasts (Fig. 6). This difference was statis-\ntically signi\ufb01cant (t test, P = 0.00011; n = 17). When\ncolocalization of SYP41 with VHAa1-GFP was com-\npared between the wild type and the tno1 mutant, no\ndifference was observed (Fig. 6), suggesting that loss\nof TNO1 speci\ufb01cally affects the localization of SYP61\nand not SYP41.\nLack of TNO1 Causes the Secretion of Vacuolar Proteins\nDisruption of vacuolar transport typically leads to\nthe secretion of vacuolar proteins by a default pathway\n(Shimada et al., 1997, 2003a). Previously, disruption of\neither of the SYP41-interacting proteins, AtVPS45 or\nVTI12, was shown to cause the secretion of aleurain\nand of a vacuolar marker consisting of CLAVATA3\nfused to the vacuolar sorting signal from barley\n(Hordeum vulgare) lectin (Sanmart\u0131\u00b4n et al., 2007; Zouhar\net al., 2009). Therefore, we hypothesized that lack\nof TNO1 may also cause the secretion of vacuolar\nproteins.\nTo test the potential involvement of TNO1 in vac-\nuolar traf\ufb01cking, we compared the amount of the\nFigure 4.

Proteins in the ICF were ana-\nlyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against\nAALP, RD21, and invertase, with the cytoplasmic pro-\nteins ChlI (stromal) and PEX11d (peroxisomal) used as\ncontrols to rule out differences in cell breakage between\nmutant and wild-type plants. AALP, RD21, and inver-\ntase bands in ICF-depleted leaf extract showed no\ndifference between the wild type and the tno1 mutant,\nas expected from the above results with isolated vacu-\noles. However, the tno1 mutant had increased levels of\nAALP and RD21 in the ICF compared with wild-type\nplants, suggesting that lack of TNO1 caused some\nsecretion of AALP and RD21 (Fig. 7B). By contrast, no\nsecretion of vacuolar invertase was observed, although\nvacuolar invertase was suggested previously to be\ntransported to the vacuole by a similar pathway to\nRD21 (Rojo et al., 2003). RD21, therefore, may have an\nalternative or additional transport pathway to the vac-\nuole. These data suggest that TNO1 is required for\nef\ufb01cient traf\ufb01cking of some vacuolar proteins.\nInvolvement of TNO1 in Vesicle Fusion\nIn Arabidopsis, the traf\ufb01cking inhibitor BFA targets\nthe Arf-GEF GNOM and induces the formation of BFA\ncompartments (Geldner et al., 2001), most likely by\nhomotypic fusion of the TGN (which is also an early\nendosome) and heterotypic fusion between the TGN\nand other endosomes (Dettmer et al., 2006; Lam et al.,\n2009; Viotti et al., 2010). Therefore, SNAREs at the TGN\nmayfunction in these fusion events upon BFA treat-\nment. As TNO1 interacts with SYP41 and loss of TNO1\nFigure 6. Mislocalization of SYP61 in the tno1 mutant.

Vol. 156, 2011\ndisrupts the localization of SYP61, TNO1 could be\ninvolved in membrane fusion at the TGN together\nwith the SYP41 complex.\nTherefore, formation of the BFA compartment in\nVHAa1-GFP transgenic wild-type and tno1 mutant\nseedlings was investigated. Without BFA treatment,\nthere was no difference in the appearance of VHAa1-\nGFP-positive structures in roots and cotyledons\nbetween wild-type and tno1 mutant seedlings (Fig. 8,\nA\u2013D). After 1 h of BFA treatment, VHAa1-GFP accu-\nmulated in the BFA compartments in roots of wild-\ntype seedlings, as reported previously, and in tno1\nmutant seedlings (Fig. 8, E and F; Dettmer et al., 2006).\nIn wild-type cotyledons, the BFA compartments were\nseen in the peripheral region. By contrast, VHAa1-GFP\nin tno1 mutant cotyledons did not accumulate in BFA\ncompartments after 1 h of BFA treatment (Fig. 8, G and\nH). VHAa1-GFP-labeled BFA compartments in coty-\nledons of the tno1 mutant could be seen only after 5 h\nof BFA treatment (Fig. 8K). No difference was seen in\nrecovery from BFA treatment between wild-type and\ntno1 mutant plants (Fig. 8, I and J).\nThe response of TNO1 to BFA treatment was also\ninvestigated. VHAa1-GFP transgenic seedlings were\ntreated in MS liquid medium supplemented with 50 mM\nBFA for 2 h, followed by \ufb01xing and immunolabeling\nusing TNO1 antibody. TNO1 was not found in the\nVHAa1-GFP-labeled BFA compartment but instead\nremained in small punctate structures similar to those\nin the absence of BFA. After BFA treatment, TNO1\ncolocalized with the remaining small VHAa1-GFP-\nlabeled structures (Fig. 8, L\u2013O), suggesting that TNO1\nis present in TGN remnants that do not undergo fusion.\nTogether, these results suggest that lack of TNO1\ndelays homotypic fusion between TGN or fusion be-\ntween TGN and other endosomes in cotyledons. The\nBFA compartment, therefore, forms more slowly in the\ntno1 mutant, presumably due to delayed fusion. TNO1\nmay function in maintaining TGN structure or iden-\ntity, marking TGN remnants that do not participate in\nBFA compartment formation.\nDISCUSSION\nIdentity of TNO1\nTNO1 was identi\ufb01ed as a novel protein that coim-\nmunoprecipitates with SYP41. As SYP41 is a t-SNARE\nresiding at the TGN, we hypothesize that TNO1 may\nalso be involved in vesicle fusion at this organelle. We\nhave demonstrated that TNO1 is involved in salt and\nosmotic stress responses and is required for ef\ufb01cient\nvacuolar traf\ufb01cking. Based on the effects of BFA treat-\nment, TNO1 is proposed to be involved in the forma-\ntion of the BFA compartment and may function in\nmaintaining TGN structure or identity.\nWhen we analyzed its potential domain structure\nusing the Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval\nFigure 8.

Vol. 156, 2011\n521\nTool, two previously characterized domains (SMC_\nprok_B and SMC_N) containing long coiled-coil re-\ngions for protein interaction were identi\ufb01ed in TNO1\n(Akhmedov et al., 1998; Geer et al., 2002). Although\nSMC domains are commonly found in structural main-\ntenance of chromosome proteins, they are also found\nin other proteins with multiple coiled-coil domains,\nsuch as vesicle-tethering factors and cytoskeleton-\nbinding proteins. A search for proteins with sequence\nsimilarity to TNO1 using the BLASTalgorithm (Altschul\net al., 1997, 2005) identi\ufb01ed several hypothetical pro-\nteins from other plant species as most closely related to\nTNO1. In addition, myosin-related proteins, a putative\nATP-binding protein, and tethering factors including\nUSO1 in yeast, tgolgin-1 in mouse, and gigantin in\nhuman were identi\ufb01ed with high signi\ufb01cance, primar-\nily due to the presence of long coiled-coil regions in\nthese proteins.\nUSO1, which has 20% amino acid sequence identity\nand 39% amino acid similarity to TNO1, is a tethering\nfactor involved in ER-to-Golgi traf\ufb01cking that tethers\nCOPII vesicles at the cis-Golgi (Cao et al., 1998).\nTethering factors have been reported to function in\nvesicle fusion by interacting with their tethering part-\nner to pull vesicles close to their target membrane (Cao\net al., 1998). Some are also involved in maintaining\norganelle structure and assisting in the formation of\nSNARE complexes via direct interaction with a SNARE\n(Shorter et al., 2002; Vasile et al., 2003). The presence of\nmultiple predicted coiled-coil domains and the similar-\nity to USO1 suggest that TNO1 could be a tethering\nfactor at the TGN.\nPhenotype of the tno1 Knockout Mutant\nTo determine the function of TNO1, the tno1 mutant\nwas isolated and four major phenotypes were identi-\n\ufb01ed: sensitivity to high salt and osmotic stress, partial\nsecretion of some vacuolar proteins, mislocalization\nof SYP61, and delayed BFA compartment formation\nin cotyledon cells. Differing effects on salt tolerance\nhave been seen for mutations in different traf\ufb01cking\nproteins. Knockdown of AtVAMP7C, a v-SNARE in-\nvolved in vesicle fusion with the vacuole, was found to\nconfer salt tolerance by preventing hydrogen peroxide-\ncontaining vesicles from fusing with the tonoplast\n(Leshem et al., 2006). Knockout of SYP22, a t-SNARE\nin the PVC and tonoplast, also increased salt tolerance\nin shoots, and a decreased level of Na+ in shoots was\nobserved (Hamaji et al., 2009). Thus, vesicle fusion\nappears to directly or indirectly affect salt tolerance at\nthe PVC and vacuoles. By contrast, the tno1 mutant\nand a mutation in SYP61 (Zhu et al., 2002) showed a\nsalt-sensitive phenotype. TNO1 and SYP61 colocalize\nto the TGN and are likely to exist in the same protein\ncomplex. The salt-sensitive phenotype of the tno1\nmutant may be due to its effect on SYP61 (Fig. 6). In\nthe tno1 mutant, less SYP61 colocalized with VHAa1-\nGFP-labeled TGN compared with wild-type plants,\nleading to possible reduced SYP61 function in salt\ntolerance. It was hypothesized that a cation trans-\nporter in the osm1/syp61 mutant may not function\ncorrectly, affecting guard cell turgor and salt sensitiv-\nity (Zhu et al., 2002). Extensive investigations of cation\ntransporters in yeast, plants, and mammalian cells\nhave shown that cation/H+ antiporters in the Golgi,\nTGN, endosome, and PVC regulate the pH and cation\nconcentration in these organelles, affecting vesicle\ntraf\ufb01cking, and knockdown of VHAa1 in Arabidopsis\nalso leads to increased salt sensitivity (Brett et al., 2002,\n2005; Nakamura et al., 2005; Pardo et al., 2006; Fuji\net al., 2007; Krebs et al., 2010). Thus, one possibility is\nthat the salt-sensitive phenotype of the tno1 and osm1/\nsyp61 mutants could be caused by defects in the\nTable I.

Vol. 156, 2011\ntransport of cation/H+ antiporters or in the function of\ncation/H+ antiporters at the TGN.\nAnother noticeable phenotype is the secretion of\nnormally vacuolar proteins in the tno1 mutant. Anal-\nysis of ICF from the tno1 mutant demonstrated partial\nsecretion of AALP, in common with mutants in the\nadditional SYP41 complex components VPS45 and\nVTI12 (Sanmart\u0131\u00b4n et al., 2007; Zouhar et al., 2009).\nAALP has dual vacuolar targeting signals and is a\ncargo for VSR1 (Hinz et al., 2007). Therefore, TNO1,\nAtVPS45, and VTI12 may cooperate in VSR1-mediated\nvacuolar traf\ufb01cking via recycling of VSR1 from PVC to\nTGN. RD21 is another protein that is partially secreted\nin the tno1 mutant. RD21 is a Cys protease like AALP\nbut is probably transported via a VSR1-independent\npathway. RD21 and invertase are transported to the\nvacuole by ER bodies rather than by the VSR1-medi-\nated transport pathway (Hayashi et al., 2001; Rojo\net al., 2003); however, invertase was not secreted in the\ntno1 mutant. This result may indicate that RD21 can\nfollow an alternative transport pathway to the vacu-\nole. Protein pro\ufb01les from isolated vacuoles of wild-\ntype and tno1 mutant leaf protoplasts were compared\nby two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, but no signif-\nicant differences were observed (data not shown). This\nis most likely due to only a small fraction of proteins\nbeing secreted, with most protein still being correctly\ntransported to the vacuole. The partial secretion of\nvacuolar proteins, therefore, may be an indirect effect\nof the loss of TNO1.\nAlthough salt sensitivity and secretion of some\nvacuolar proteins in the tno1 mutant may appear to be\nindependent phenotypes, these two phenotypes are\nclosely related. A connection between salt sensitivity\nand vacuolar traf\ufb01cking has been well established. In\nyeast and mammalian cells, post-Golgi organelles\ninvolved in vacuolar traf\ufb01cking were shown to be\ntargets for salt stress, resulting in inef\ufb01cient vacuolar\ntraf\ufb01cking (Bachert et al., 2001; Pardo et al., 2006;\nHerna\u00b4ndez et al., 2009). In Arabidopsis, the endocytic\npathway to the vacuole has also been shown to be\nimportant for salt tolerance (Leshem et al., 2006,\n2007). Thus, our results provide additional evidence\nthat vacuolar traf\ufb01cking is important for salt toler-\nance.\nBFA Treatment\nIn this study, we used BFA to investigate the in-\nvolvement of TNO1 in fusion events, as TNO1 is a\nmember of a protein complex predicted to be required\nfor membrane fusion at the TGN and BFA treatment\ncauses the formation of BFA compartments by fusion\nbetween multiple types of endosomes. As expected,\nVHAa1-GFP transgenic plants formed BFA compart-\nments after 1 h of BFA treatment, but VHAa1-GFP\ntransgenic tno1 mutant plants showed formation of\nBFA compartments only after 5 h of BFA treatment in\ncotyledon cells, while mutant root cells behaved iden-\ntically to wild-type cells in this assay. This delay in\nBFA compartment formation implies that TNO1 could\nbe involved in homotypic fusion of the TGN/early\nendosomes or fusion between TGN and other types of\nendosomes upon BFA treatment.\nVHAa1-GFP and TNO1 colocalize extensively un-\nder normal conditions; however, loss of colocalization\nwas observed upon BFA treatment, indicating that\nTNO1 does not enter BFA compartments (Fig. 8). A\nsimilar effect was observed for the mammalian golgin\nGM130, which, unlike most Golgi proteins, does not\nrelocate to the ER in the presence of BFA (Seemann\net al., 2000). GM130 is a tethering factor that also\ninteracts with SNAREs during vesicle fusion and a\nGolgi matrix protein required for the integrity of the\nGolgi structure (Diao et al., 2008). After BFA treatment,\nGM130 remains in a Golgi remnant, while Golgi lu-\nminal proteins are transported back to the ER, indi-\ncating that GM130 is involved in maintaining Golgi\nstructure (Seemann et al., 2000). Although there is no\nsequence homology between TNO1 and GM130, based\non the properties of TNO1, it is possible that TNO1\nalso functions as a tethering factor and is involved in\nmaintaining TGN structure or identity. In vitro fusion\nassays using recombinant TNO1 and TGN SNAREs\nmay provide insight into the role of TNO1 in mem-\nbrane fusion events.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nIdenti\ufb01cation of TNO1\nProtein extracts were made essentially as described by Bassham et al.\n(2000) and Sanderfoot et al. (2001a). Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)\nsuspension cells were ground in extraction buffer (phosphate-buffered\nsaline [PBS], 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl \ufb02uoride, and 1%\n[v/v] Triton X-100) and solubilized for 2 h at 4\u0004C. Solubilized proteins were\nadded to a column containing immobilized SYP41 antibodies or SYP41\npreimmune serum and incubated for 2 h at 4\u0004C. The columns were washed\n\ufb01ve times with extraction buffer, and bound proteins were eluted using 0.2 M\nGly, pH 2.5. Immunoprecipitates from SYP41 and preimmune antibody\nwere separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized using silver staining.\nProtein bands migrating at approximate molecular masses of 200, 67,\n35, and 15 kD were excised and analyzed at the Protein Microsequencing\nand Proteomic Mass Spectroscopy Laboratory at the University of Mas-\nsachusetts Medical School (Worchester, MA). Proteins were digested in gel\nusing trypsin, the resulting peptides were applied to a Finnigan Electro-\nspray LCQ Deca ion-trap mass spectrometer, and the peptide masses were\nused to identify potential matches within the Arabidopsis proteome.\ncDNA Cloning and Sequencing\nRNA was extracted from Arabidopsis siliques and treated with DNase I,\nfollowed by RT using an oligo(dT) primer. cDNAs were ampli\ufb01ed using\nHerculase Long and Accurate Polymerase Mix (Agilent Technologies) and\nTNO1 cDNA forward and reverse primers (Table I) according to the manu-\nfacturer\u2019s protocol. The ampli\ufb01cation product was inserted into pGEM T-Easy\nvector (Invitrogen), and DNA sequencing was performed at the W.M. Keck\nFoundation (Yale University). The sequence was deposited in GenBank\n(accession no. HM776995).\nPlant Materials and Growth Conditions\nArabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) seeds were surface sterilized and grown\non soil or MS Vitamin and Salt Mixture (Caisson Laboratories) solid medium\nRole of TNO1 in Vesicle Traf\ufb01cking\nPlant Physiol. Vol. 156, 2011\n523\ncontaining 1% (w/v) Suc. A tno1 knockout mutant line (Salk_112503) that has\na T-DNA insertion in the third exon was obtained from the Arabidopsis\nBiological Resource Center. A homozygous tno1 mutant was identi\ufb01ed by PCR\nusing TNO1 internal forward and reverse primers and T-DNA left border-a1\nprimer (Table I).\nGeneration of Transgenic Plants\nGFP-fused vacuolar H+-ATPase (GFP-VHAa1) plasmid (Dettmer et al.,\n2006) was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV2260, which was\nused to transform tno1 mutant plants by the \ufb02oral dipping method (Clough\nand Bent, 1998). The resulting VHAa1-GFP-transformed tno1 plants were\nselected on MS solid medium containing 50 mg mL21 kanamycin.\nFor tno1 mutant complementation, the full-length TNO1 gene and its pro-\nmoter were separately ampli\ufb01ed by PCR with TNO1 promoter primers and\ngenomic TNO1 primers with corresponding restriction sites (Table I). The TNO1\npromoter fragment was digested using SalI and NotI, and the TNO1 genomic\nfragment was digested using NotI and KpnI. The digested TNO1 promoter and\ngenomic DNA were ligated into the binary vector pCAMBIA1300MCS1 digested\nusing SalI and KpnI (Sanderfoot et al., 2001a). The resulting plasmid was\nintroduced into A. tumefaciens strain GV2260, which was used to transform\ntno1 mutant plants. The transgenic tno1 mutant plants were identi\ufb01ed by\nresistance to 50 mg mL21 hygromycin and immunoblotting with TNO1 antibody.\nRT-PCR Analysis of TNO1, SYP41, and Salt/Osmotic\nStress-Responsive Genes\nTotal RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis organs using the TRIzol\nRNA isolation method (http://www.Arabidopsis.org/portals/masc/AFGC/\nRevisedAFGC/site2RnaL.htm#isolation). Roots were harvested from 4-week-\nold Arabidopsis plants grown in liquid culture (MS plus 1% [w/v] Suc), and\nstems, rosette leaves, cauline leaves, \ufb02owers, and siliques were harvested from\n7-week-old Arabidopsis plants grown in soil. Extracted RNA was treated with\nDNase I, followed by RTusing an oligo(dT) primer. cDNAs were ampli\ufb01ed for\n25 cycles using TNO1 internal forward and reverse primers or SYP41 forward\nand reverse primers (Table I).\nOne-week-old wild-type and tno1 mutant seedlings were treated with\n300 mM NaCl, 40 mM LiCl, 300 mM KCl, or 600 mM mannitol for 5 h. Total RNA\nwas extracted from the seedlings, and expression of SOS1, DREB2A, RD29,\nTNO1, and SYP61 was analyzed by RT-PCR using gene-speci\ufb01c primers (Table I;\nYamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 1993a; Liu et al., 1998; Shi et al., 2000; Zhu\net al., 2002).\nAntibody Production and Puri\ufb01cation\nA 1.7-kb C-terminal fragment of the TNO1 cDNAwas cloned into pET28b(+)\nexpression vector (Novagen) to produce a His-partial TNO1 fusion construct.\nThe fusion protein construct was introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and\nexpression and puri\ufb01cation of partial TNO1 were as described by Bassham et al.\n(2000). The partial TNO1 was puri\ufb01ed using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose\nand used to immunize rabbits at Cocalico Biologicals after gel puri\ufb01cation.\nFor puri\ufb01cation of TNO1-speci\ufb01c antibodies, puri\ufb01ed His-tagged TNO1\nprotein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane\nfollowed by staining with Ponceau S, and the strip containing the fusion protein\nwas cut out. The strip was blocked in 3% (w/v) dried nonfat milk in PBS, and\ncrude rabbit serum was incubated with the strip for 2 h at 4\u0004C. The strip was\nwashed \ufb01ve times with PBS, and antibodies were eluted using 0.1 M Gly, pH 2.2.\nDifferential Centrifugation\nArabidopsis plants were homogenized in 0.3 M Suc, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,\n1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl \ufb02uoride. The homogenate was\ncentrifuged at 1,000g for 10 min at 4\u0004C to remove cell debris. The supernatant was\ncentrifuged at 20,000g, then the supernatant was removed and further centri-\nfuged at 100,000g. The TCA-precipitated supernatant after centrifugation at\n100,000g and pellets after centrifugation at 20,000g and 100,000g were analyzed\nby immunoblotting with TNO1 and SYP61 antibodies (Sanderfoot et al., 2001a).\nExtraction of TNO1 from Membranes\nTotal membrane fractions were isolated from 2-week-old seedlings by\ncentrifugation at 125,000g and treated with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 M urea, 1 M\nNaCl, or 0.1 M Na2CO3 followed by pelleting of nonsolubilized proteins at\n125,000g (Phan et al., 2008). Pellets and TCA-precipitated supernatants were\nanalyzed by immunoblotting with TNO1 and SYP41 antibodies.\nICF Extraction\nICF was extracted as described (Neuhaus et al., 1991). One gram of\nArabidopsis leaves was in\ufb01ltrated under vacuum in 50 mM sodium citrate, pH\n5.5. After in\ufb01ltration, surface dried leaves were rolled with \ufb01lter paper and\ninserted into a 10-mL syringe. The syringe was inserted into a 50-mL conical\ntube, which was centrifuged at 1,000g for 10 min at 10\u0004C. ICF was collected in\nthe bottom of the tube, and ICF-depleted leaves after centrifugation were\nground in 50 mM sodium citrate for the control. ICF and ICF-depleted protein\nextract were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-AALP (1:1,000; Ahmed\net al., 2000), anti-RD21 (1:1,000; Hayashi et al., 2001), anti-invertase (1:3,000;\nRojo et al., 2003), anti-ChlI (1:2,000; Adhikari et al., 2009), and anti-PEX11d\n(1:1,000; Orth et al., 2007).\nPreparation of Vacuoles\nLeaf protoplasts were generated as described (Sheen, 2002). After harvest-\ning protoplasts, vacuole isolation was performed as described (Robert et al.,\n2007). After adding 6 mL of prewarmed lysis buffer (0.2 M mannitol, 10%\n[w/v] Ficoll, 1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM Na phosphate, pH 8.0) at 42\u0004C, lysed\nprotoplasts were transferred to clear tubes for a SW41 swinging-bucket rotor\n(Beckman-Coulter) and overlaid with 3 mL of 4% (w/v) Ficoll (by mixing lysis\nand vacuole buffer) and 1 mL of vacuole buffer (0.45 M mannitol, 2 mM EDTA,\nand 5 mM Na phosphate, pH 7.5) followed by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for\n50 min at 10\u0004C. Vacuoles were recovered from the interface between 4% (w/v)\nFicoll and vacuole buffer.\nImmuno\ufb02uorescence\nThree- or 4-d-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on MS solid medium were\nimmunolabeled with a protocol slightly modi\ufb01ed from Phan et al. (2008).\nSeedlings used were ST-GFP transgenic plants (Boevink et al., 1998), VHAa1-\nGFP transgenic plants (Dettmer et al., 2006), and RHA1-YFP transgenic plants\n(Preuss et al., 2004) to label Golgi, TGN, and PVC, respectively.\nFor protoplast immuno\ufb02uorescence, protoplasts were \ufb01xed in 3% (w/v)\nparaformaldehyde in MTSB (50 mM PIPES-KOH, pH 6.9, 5 mM EGTA, and\n5 mM MgSO4) with 0.4 M sorbitol for 30 min and washed twice with MTSB with\n0.4 M sorbitol. Fixed protoplasts were mounted onto slides and dried for 1 h.\nProtoplasts were permeabilized using permeabilization buffer (0.5% [v/v]\nNonidet P-40 and 10% [v/v] dimethyl sulfoxide in MTSB) for 30 min in a\nmoist chamber followed by washing three times using MTSB. Samples were\nblocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in MTSB for 2 h, and primary\nantibodies in 3% (w/v) BSA in MTSB were added. After 3 h of incubation,\nprotoplasts were washed three times using MTSB and treated with conjugated\nsecondary antibody in 3% (w/v) BSA in MTSB for 50 min followed by\nwashing \ufb01ve times with MTSB. Anti-TNO1 (1:25), anti-SYP41 (1:50), and anti-\nSYP61 (1:50) were used as primary antibodies. AlexaFluor 594-conjugated\ngoat anti-rabbit IgG (1:250) was used as secondary antibody.\nFluorescent signals were viewed with a confocal laser scanning microscope\n(Leica SP5; Leica Microsystems). Excitation and emission wavelengths of GFP\nwere 488 and 500 nm and those of AlexaFluor 594 were 590 and 600 nm,\nrespectively.\nSalt, Ionic, and Osmotic Stresses and Drug Treatment\nFor stress treatment, seedlings were grown on MS solid medium for 5 d\nand transferred to MS solid medium containing 130 mM NaCl, 17 mM LiCl, 140\nmM KCl, or 300 mM mannitol, followed by growth for an additional 10 d (Zhu\net al., 2002).\nFor BFA treatment, seedlings were grown on MS solid medium for 4 d and\ntransferred to MS liquid medium containing 50 mM BFA or dimethyl sulfoxide\nas carrier control for 5 h. Seedlings were washed twice with MS liquid medium\nand incubated in MS liquid medium for recovery. BFA treatment of protoplasts\nwas performed as above for 2 h with the same concentration of BFA.\nSequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank/EMBL data\nlibraries under accession number HM776995.\nKim and Bassham\n524\nPlant Physiol.

Based on the similarity of its amino acid sequence to metazoan \nfucosyltransferases, we have named this novel protein AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thaliana GlycosylTransferase-Like Protein) \nand predicted that it should be a member of yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis fucosyltransferases, as it shows no \nsignificant sequence similarity to fucosyltransferases previously identified in Arabidopsis. AtGTLP is a membrane-anchored \nprotein, which exhibits a type II-like topology, with a single transmembrane helix and a globular domain in the C-terminal \npart of its amino acid sequence. Colocalization data we collected suggest that AtGTLP should localize mainly to Golgi \napparatus, especially to certain zones of trans-Golgi. As single atgtlp\u2212/\u2212 mutants showed no obvious difference in phenotype \n(primary root length and fresh mass), AtGTLP and proteins related to AtGTLP with high similarity in amino acid sequences \nmay have redundant functions.\nKey words:\t glycosylation, Golgi apparatus, membrane trafficking, trans-Golgi network.\nIntroduction\nAn efficient and well-organized intracellular transport \nsystem is a basic requirement for life to exist, as many \ncomponents necessary for metabolic processes, that \ntake place inside or outside of a eukaryotic cell, are \nproduced and subsequently modified in different cell \ncompartments. The transport system responsible for \ndelivering cargo collected from one compartment (that \nis: a membrane-enclosed organelle, such as endoplasmic \nreticulum, Golgi, or vacuole) to its next destination has \nbeen given the name of \u201cmembrane traffic\u201d.\nIn the membrane traffic, macromolecules are packed \nas cargo into vesicles, which then carry the cargo to \nanother organelle, plasma membrane or extracellular \nspace. SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive \nfactor attachment receptor) proteins, a family of \nmembrane-anchored proteins comprising of more than \n60 members in Arabidopsis (Sanderfoot 2007), play \nan important role in this transport system. Assisted by \nother molecules, such as Rab GTPases and tethering \nfactors, SNAREs mediate fusion between the membrane \nof vesicle carrying the cargo and the membrane of the \norganelle the cargo is addressed to (Stenmark 2009). To \nfacilitate the fusion, SNAREs form a complex comprising \nof four SNAREs\u2014three Q-SNAREs (Qa-, Qb-, Qc-\nSNARE), which reside on the target membrane and \nare characterized by the presence of glutamine as the \ncentral amino acid in SNARE motif, in addition to one \nR-SNARE residing on the transport vesicle, with arginine \nas the central amino acid (Fasshauer et al. 1998). When a \nR-SNARE comes into contact with the three Q-SNAREs, \nfirst a link is formed between the vesicle and the target \nmembrane, and subsequently, due to the change in \nconformation of the SNARE complex from \u201cloose\u201d \nto \u201ctight\u201d state, the vesicle is pulled toward the target \nmembrane, allowing the two membranes to fuse together \nand the cargo to enter the lumen of the organelle (Jahn \nand Scheller 2006). To ensure the specificity of fusion, a \nlarge number of SNAREs localizes selectively to a specific \ncell compartment. This characteristic made it possible \nfor those SNAREs to be successfully used as organelle \nAbbreviations: FUT, fucosyltransferase; GT, glycosyltransferase; POFUT, protein O-fucosyltransferase; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive \nfactor attachment receptor; SYP, syntaxin of plants; TGN, trans-Golgi network.\nPublished online March 20, 2024\nOriginal Paper\n36\t\nNovel Golgi-localized putative glycosyltransferase protein\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Japanese Society for Plant Biotechnology\nmarkers in subcellular localization studies (Uemura et al. \n2004).\nThrough their crucial role in membrane trafficking, \nmembers of SNARE family in plants were reported to be \nimplicit in a variety of biological processes, ranging from \ngrowth to biotic/abiotic stress resistance. One group of \nSNAREs, that has been linked to secretion-dependent \nresistance against pathogens, is SYP4 (SYNTAXIN \nof PLANTs 4) group. SYP4 group comprises of three \nmembers (SYP41, SYP42 and SYP43) with partially \noverlapping functions, all localizing to the TGN (trans-\nGolgi network). syp42\u2212/\u2212syp43\u2212/\u2212 double mutant \nexhibits phenotype of shorter roots, semi-dwarfism, and \nearly senescence, in addition to increase in susceptibility \nto host-adapted virulent powdery fungus Golovinomyces \norontii infection, when compared to wild type (Uemura \net al. 2012).\nA research focused on interactome of Qa-SNARE \nproteins in Arabidopsis reported a number of new \ninteractions between specific SNARE proteins and \nnumerous proteins of diverse functions, including novel \nproteins with unknown functions (Fujiwara et al. 2014). \nOne such interaction was found between SYP43 and \nan uncharacterized protein, which we decided to name \nAtGTLP (Arabidopsis thaliana GlycosylTransferase-Like \nProtein) due to the similarity to glycosyltransferases in its \namino acid sequence.\nGlycosyltransferases (GTs) are a large family of \nenzymes, characterized by their ability to transfer \nsugar moieties to a specific acceptor substrate creating \na glycosidic bond. GTs are known to produce a variety \nof glycoproteins and small sugar-containing molecules \nwith diverse biological roles, but in plants, these enzymes \nare especially important for processing products of \nphotosynthesis and for biosynthesis of cell-wall (Keegstra \nand Raikhel 2001). At present, 567 Arabidopsis proteins \nrecorded in the Carbohydrate Active Enzyme Database \n(CAZy) (Cantarel et al. 2009; http://www.cazy.org/\ne1.html, accessed Nov 1, 2023) with \u2018GlycosylTransferase\u2019 \nannotation have been further classified into 45 of 117 \nGT families known today (including GT0 or GTnc, \n\u2018non-classified\u2019). Independently from the sequence-\nbased classification implemented in CAZy database, \nGTs can also be categorized according to the type of \nsugar they use as a substrate. One such example is the \nsuperfamily of fucosyltransferases (FUTs), which utilize \nguanidine 5\u2032-diphosphate-\u03b2-L-fucose (GDP-Fuc) as \na substrate (Martinez-Duncker et al. 2003). In plants, \nmacromolecules known to incorporate fucose in their \nstructures are N-glycans, O-fucosylated proteins, as \nwell as components of cell walls, such as xyloglucans, \narabinogalactan proteins and pectic polysaccharides\u2014\nrhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) and rhamnogalacturonan \nII (RG-II) (Soto et al. 2019). Based on characteristics \nof FUTs that have been identified thus far (a majority \nof which are putative fucosyltransferases), it has been \nestablished that fucose is attached to each of these \ntypes of macromolecules by a specific FUT(s). As our \nknowledge about plant FUTs is still lacking, the full \nscope of their biological functions is, at present, not fully \nunderstood.\nIn the present study, we observed subcellular \nlocalization of AtGTLP by cross-pollinating a transgenic \nArabidopsis line expressing AtGTLP-mGFP construct \nwith organelle marker lines, as the first step to investigate \nthe functions of AtGTLP.\nMaterials and methods\nPlant material and growth conditions\nFor colocalization observations, Arabidopsis plants were grown \nin growth chamber, in 22\u00b0C in long-day light (16\u2009h/8\u2009h, L/D) \nconditions on MS medium w/vitamins (Duchefa Biochemie), \ncontaining 0.3% gellan gum (Wako) and 2% sucrose. pH was \nadjusted to 6.265. Fluorescence was observed in cells in the \nelongation zone of roots of 5-day-old seedlings.\nFor analysis of mutant phenotype, two T-DNA insertion \nlines SALK_025999 (atgtlp-1) and SALK_011654 (atgtlp-2) \nwere used. Columbia-0 accession plants were used as a \ncontrol. Growth conditions and medium were the same as for \ncolocalization analysis. For statistical analysis of primary root \nlength and fresh mass, 25 individuals (11-day-old) were used \nfor each genotype.\nRNA extraction and RT-PCR\nRNA was extracted from 10-day-old Arabidopsis seedling \nwith RNeasy\u00ae Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). 100\u2009mg of fresh tissue \nwas used for each sample. cDNA was synthesized using \nSuperScript\u2122 III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher \nScientific). 5\u2009\u00b5g of the extracted RNA was added to each \nreaction as a template. The presence or lack of AtGTLP \nexpression in mutant lines was confirmed by PCR reaction \nusing ExTaq polymerase (Takara). 1\u2009\u00b5g of cDNA was used as a \ntemplate. Primers used for RT-PCR are listed in Supplementary \nTable S1.\nGene cloning\nA 5.1\u2009kbp fragment of nucleotide sequence comprising of the \nnative promoter and AtGTLP (At2g04280) gene sequence \nflanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs was amplified using PrimeSTAR\u00ae \nGXL DNA Polymerase (Takara). The amplified sequence was \nsubsequently subcloned into a pENTR\u2122 vector using pENTR\u2122/\nD-TOPO Vector Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) for directional \ncloning. The vector was used to transform One Shot\u2122 TOP10 \nChemically Competent Escherichia coli (ThermoFisher \nScientific).\nTransformants were selected on solid LB medium with \nkanamycin 50\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 and cultured overnight in liquid LB \nwith the same antibiotic concentration. Isolated plasmid was \nlinearized and fused with monomeric GFP (mGFP) (Segami \n\t\n\t\nN. Rzepecka et al.\t\n37\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Japanese Society for Plant Biotechnology\net al. 2014) gene sequence using In-Fusion HD Kit (Takara). \nProduct of this reaction was used to transform competent \nE. coli cells and the transformants selection procedure was \nrepeated. Isolated plasmid was used as the entry clone for \npHGW vector (Karimi et al. 2002) as the destination vector in \nGateway\u2122 LR Clonase\u2122 II reaction (ThermoFisher Scientific). \nAtGTLP-mGFP in pHGW construct was transformed into \ncompetent E. coli cells and transformant colonies were selected \non solid LB medium with 100\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 spectinomycin.\nFor creation of mRFP-GOS12 Golgi marker line, \ntranslational fusion between mRFP (Campbell et al. 2002) and \nGOS12 were generated by inserting cDNA encoding mRFP in \nfront of the start codon of GOS12 genomic sequence including \n1.9\u2009kb of the 5\u2032-flanking sequence and 1.2\u2009kb of the 3\u2032-flanking \nsequence in pENTR\u2122 vector using In-Fusion HD Kit. The \nresulted mRFP-GOS12 construct was subcloned into pGWB1 \nby LR Clonase\u2122 II (Nakagawa et al. 2007).\nPrimers used for gene cloning and linearization are listed in \nSupplementary Table S1.\nGeneration of Arabidopsis transformants\nCol-0 plants were infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens \ntransformed with the prepared plasmid containing the \nAtGTLP-mGFP construct using flower dip method (Clough and \nBent 1998). Collected seeds were sown on MS medium with 2% \nsucrose, 0.8% agar with 25\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 of hygromycin and 250\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 \nof claforan.\nSelection of T1 lines with a single AtGTLP-mGFP construct \nwas conducted by sowing T2 seeds on selective MS medium \nwith hygromycin. Lines, for which we observed 3\u2009:\u20091 segregation \nratio of resistant to non-resistant plants, were selected as single-\ninsertion lines.\nConfocal laser scanning microscopy observations\nFor subcellular localization observations of AtGTLP protein, \nAtGTLP-mGFP single-insertion lines were cross-pollinated \nwith organelle markers lines. mRFP-VAMP721 (Uemura et al. \n2019) and tagRFP-VAMP727 (Ebine et al. 2008) lines were used \nas markers for transport vesicle from the TGN to the cell plate/\nplasma membrane or to the vacuole, respectively. mRFP-SYP61 \n(Shimizu et al. 2021), mRFP-SYP43 (Asaoka et al. 2013), and \nVHAa1-mRFP (Dettmer et al. 2006) lines were used as TGN \nmarkers. ST-mRFP was used as a trans-Golgi marker (Uemura \net al. 2012) and mRFP-GOS12 as a Golgi marker (in this study).\nColocalization observations were conducted using Zeiss \nLSM980 with Airyscan 2 confocal laser scanning microscope \nsystem equipped with Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40 Oil DIC M27 \nimmersion objective. Excitation laser wavelengths of 488\u2009nm \nand 543\u2009nm were used. Pinhole was set to 1AU.\nColocalization analysis\nThe degree of colocalization of each organelle marker with \nAtGTLP-mGFP was assessed by calculating Pearson correlation \ncoefficient (PCC) (Adler and Parmryd 2010; Dunn et al. 2011). \nTo obtain PCC values, Coloc 2 plugin for Fiji/ImageJ software \n(Schindelin et al. 2012) was used. For each organelle marker, \nthree 50\u2009\u00b5m\u00d750\u2009\u00b5m images with 15 randomly selected regions \nof interest (ROIs), freehand-drawn around the observed dot-\nlike structures, were used for analysis (45 ROIs total for each \nmarker). Noise in the images was corrected using the \u2018Smooth\u2019 \nfunction of Fiji/ImageJ. Line fluorescence intensity plots were \ngenerated using RGB profiler plugin for Fiji/ImageJ.\nResults\nAtGTLP is a putative glycosyltransferase\nAtGTLP is predicted to be a membrane-anchored protein \ncomprising of 568 residues. DeepTMHMM (Hallgren et \nal. 2022; https://dtu.biolib.com/DeepTMHMM, accessed \nNov 1, 2023) transmembrane topology prediction \nmodel for this protein indicates a presence of a single \ntransmembrane helix near the N-terminus of AtGTLP \nprotein (residues 24\u201344). The short N-terminal tail of \nthe protein was predicted to localize on the cytosolic side \nof an organelle membrane, while residues 45\u2013568 reside \ninside the lumen (Figure 1A). AlphaFold2 (Jumper et al. \n2021) model of AtGTLP\u2019s three-dimensional structure \nincludes a globular domain of unknown function in the \nC-terminal part of the amino acid sequence (Figure 1B). \nThe C-terminal part of the amino-acid sequence was \nmodelled with high confidence, while N-terminal part \nhad a lower reliability score (Figure 1C\u2013E).\nAnalysis of AtGTLP\u2019s amino acid sequence using \nPhyre2 server (Kelley et al. 2015; http://www.sbg.bio.\nic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=\u200bindex, accessed \nNov 1, 2023) suggests a distant homology between \nthe C-terminal domain of AtGTLP and human protein \nO-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2; 19% of sequence \nidentity, 99.2% confidence), protein O-fucosyltransferase \n1 (POFUT1; 16% i.d., 98.9% confidence), as well as C. \nelegans protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (CePOFUT2; 20% \ni.d., 98.9% confidence) and protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 \n(CePOFUT1; 18% i.d., 99.2% confidence). Superposition \nbetween AlphaFold2 model of C-terminal domain of \nAtGTLP and the top ranked template (human POFUT2; \nPDB ID: 4AP6, A chain) is shown in Figure 1F. \nInterestingly, among top ranked templates, we observed \nno plant GTs nor other types of plant enzymes. Moreover, \nalthough the Conserved Domain Database (Lu et al. 2020; \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi, \naccessed Nov 1, 2023) recognizes the presence of \u2018O-\nFUT-like\u2019 domain in the C-terminal region of AtGTLP, \nwhen its amino acid sequence was used as a query in \nBLAST search against Arabidopsis proteome, none of the \n38 proteins that have been characterized as members of \nArabidopsis FUT family in literature (Smith et al. 2018) \nwere present among the results. No other motif that could \nsuggest possible functions of AtGTLP has been found \nto be present in its amino acid sequence. In the CAZy \ndatabase, AtGTLP is currently classified as \u2018GTnc\u2019.\n38\t\nNovel Golgi-localized putative glycosyltransferase protein\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Japanese Society for Plant Biotechnology\nAtGTLP is localized mainly on the trans-Golgi\nTo investigate the subcellular localization of AtGTLP, we \nestablished transgenic Arabidopsis expressing mGFP-\ntagged AtGTLP (AtGTLP-mGFP) under the control of \nnative promoter. The fluorescence of AtGTLP-mGFP \nprotein concentrated in dot- or ring-like structures \nscattered within the cell (Figure 2).\nIn order to reveal which organelle those structures \ncorrespond to, we established double-visualization \nArabidopsis lines expressing AtGTLP-mGFP with \nvarious RFP-tagged organelle markers. Among tested \nmarkers, the extent of colocalization of AtGTLP with \ntrans-Golgi marker, ST (Boevink et al. 1998) was the \nhighest and relatively consistent among all analyzed ROIs \n(Figure 3; PCC=\u200b0.5\u20130.91; median=\u200b0.75), suggesting \nthat a significant population of AtGTLP localizes to \ntrans-Golgi. Visual observations of colocalization of \nthese two proteins show that while both seem to often \nlocalize to the same disk-like structures, patches of \nmagenta-only and green-only fluorescence within those \nstructures were also visible (Figure 2A, \u2018close-up\u2019). Based \non this characteristic, we suspect that within trans-\nGolgi, AtGTLP segregates to specific zones only. As \nexpected, relatively high PCCs were obtained also when \ncolocalization with GOS12, a Golgi marker (Figure 2B; \nUemura et al. 2004), was analyzed (Figure 3; 0.21\u20130.83, \nmedian=\u200b0.58). However, whereas for the AtGTLP-\nmGFP/ST-mRFP pair, the two peaks representing GFP \nand RFP in side-view line fluorescence profile of a single \ndisk-like structure overlap almost entirely (Figure 4A), \nfor the AtGTLP-mGFP/mRFP-GOS12 pair a slight shift \nbetween those two peaks was observed (Figure 4B).\nMoreover, we found that in some of the analyzed ROIs, \nAtGTLP partially colocalizes with TGN markers, SYP61 \n(Figure 2C; Uemura et al. 2004) and VHAa1 (Figure 2D; \nDettmer et al. 2006), whereas in other ROIs, PCC was \nFigure\u2002 1.\u2003 (A) Schematic model of AtGTLP topology and (B) AlphaFold2 prediction of the three-dimensional structure of AtGTLP.

The gradation coloring scheme was employed from N-terminal to C-terminal side on the superposed region. \nHuman O-fucosyltransferase 2 is colored in gray with GDP analogue in ball-and-stick model which suggests the active site of the protein. Root mean \nsquare deviation (RMSD) of the backbone is 5.9\u2009\u00c5. The similarity of the location of \u03b1-helices can be noticed.\n\t\n\t\nN.

Interestingly, for the third analyzed \nTGN marker used in this study, SYP43 (Uemura et al. \n2004), we observed that areas where the two colors of \nflorescence overlap with each other, were scarcer (Figure \n2E). Relatively low degree of colocalization for AtGTLP-\nmGFP/mRFP-SYP43 pair was also reflected in lower \nPCC values (Figure 3; \u22120.17\u20130.64, with median of 0.26) \nand line fluorescence profile, which suggest that SYP43 \nlocalizes to the center of AtGTLP rings (Figure 4E).\nTaking into consideration the possibility that \nAtGTLP is transported within the cell as a cargo, two \ntransport pathway markers\u2014VAMP721, a marker of \ntransport from the TGN to the cell plate and the plasma \nmembrane, as well as VAMP727, a marker of vacuolar \ntransport (Shimizu and Uemura 2022)\u2014were also \nincluded in the study. In case of VAMP721, we observed \nvery little overlap of GFP and RFP fluorescence (Figure \n2F, Figure 4F), and low PCCs (Figure 3; \u22120.48\u20130.48, \nmedian=\u200b0.15), whereas colocalization between AtGTLP \nand VAMP727, similarly to SYP61 and VHAa1, was \ninconsistent across the analyzed ROIs (Figure 2G, Figure \n3; PCC=\u200b0.01\u20130.7, median=\u200b0.42). Line fluorescence \nprofiles for AtGTLP-GFP/tagRFP-VAMP727 pair \nalso show a pattern similar to AtGTLP-GFP/mRFP-\nSYP61 pair (Figure 4G). When inspecting the degree \nof colocalization visually, we observed that the areas of \noverlapping fluorescence were present mainly within \nclusters of dot- or ring-like structures, which most likely \ncorrespond to Golgi/TGN. In addition to these clusters, \n\u2018free\u2019 dots of tagRFP-VAMP727 signal, where AtGTLP-\nmGFP was absent, could also be observed (Figure 2G, \narrowheads).\natgtlp mutants exhibit no obvious phenotypes\nAccording to data available in eFP Browser (Klepikova \nArabidopsis Atlas; Klepikova et al. 2016), AtGTLP is \nexpressed in most parts of a plant, including roots and \nyoung leaves, with the exception of dry seeds.\nIn both mutant lines used in this study, T-DNA \ninsertion was confirmed to be present inside AtGTLP\u2019s \nexon (Figure 5A).

Based on \nthese results, we consider AtGTLP to be a resident Golgi \nprotein, localizing mainly to trans-Golgi. Furthermore, \nthe ring-like appearance of AtGTLP-mGFP fluorescence \nsuggest that it localizes mainly to the rim of Golgi \ncisternae (Tie et al. 2018).\nThe results of this study showed that the \npredicted characteristics of AtGTLP match that of \nglycosyltransferases. In eukaryotic cells, glycosylation \nprocesses are commonly thought to occur mainly in ER \nand Golgi (Hansen et al. 2010). In plants, biosynthesis \nof many cell wall polysaccharides, another process that \ninvolves GTs, was also reported to take place in Golgi \n(Keegstra and Raikhel 2001; Saint-Jore-Dupas et al. \n2004). Predicted topology model of AtGTLP suggests \nthat it possesses a short cytoplasmic N-terminal tail and a \nsingle transmembrane helix, while its globular functional \ndomain is positioned inside the lumen. Such topology, \noften described as \u2018type II topology\u2019 in literature, is \ncommon among Golgi-resident enzymes known to take \npart in protein glycosylation processes (Banfield 2011; \nHansen et al. 2010; Welch and Munro 2019).\nOur data suggest that whilst AtGTLP partially \ncolocalized with TGN markers, SYP61 and VHAa1, \nand to a lesser extent, SYP43, in a portion of the \nanalyzed ROIs, the number of ROIs, where the Pearson \ncorrelation coefficient was close to 0, which suggests \nno colocalization, is noteworthy. TGN is a vesicular-\ntubular compartment adjacent to the trans side of \na Golgi apparatus, but generally considered to be a \ndistinct organelle with functions different from the Golgi \n(Griffiths and Simons 1986). Indeed, more recently, \nexistence of two types of TGN in plant cells, Golgi-\nassociated TGN (GA-TGN) and Golgi-independent \nTGN (free-TGN/GI-TGN)\u2014a subpopulation of the TGN \nthat is physiologically separated from Golgi stacks, has \nbeen reported (Staehelin and Kang 2008; Uemura et al. \n2014; Viotti et al. 2010). The general role of TGN is to \nreceive proteins modified in Golgi and direct them either \nfor vacuoles, the plasma membrane or for secretion \n(Griffiths and Simons 1986) and therefore, this organelle \nis considered to be an important hub in the membrane \ntraffic system, where cargo proteins are sorted, before \nbeing dispatched for their next destination (Keller and \nSimons 1997).

In mammalian \ncells, some types of sugars, such as galactose and sialic \nacid, can be added to glycans in the TGN by TGN-\nlocalized GTs (Rabouille et al. 1995; Stanley 2011). In \nplants, however, there are no reports of glycotransferase \nactivity in the TGN. Based on the collected data, we \ntherefore propose that AtGTLP is a trans-Golgi-localized \nprotein.\nAtGTLP\u2014a novel fucosyltransferase?\nAnalysis of AtGTLP amino acid sequence has shown \nthat its C-terminal domain bears resemblance to \nthe conserved domain found in metazoan POFUTs, \nalthough no obvious sequence similarity was found \nbetween AtGTLP and the proteins which have been \npreviously classified as members of FUT family in \nArabidopsis. Although, at present, we lack evidence \nthat would confirm GT or FUT activity in AtGTLP, we \nconsider that this protein may potentially belong to a \nyet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis proteins with \neither GT or FUT activity.\nOne interesting possibility that is worth considering \nis that AtGTLP is indeed a POFUT. Phylogenetic \nanalyses report putative POFUTs in plants and suggest \nplant POFUTs are phylogenetically distant from \nPOFUTs families in other organisms (POFUT1 and \nPOFUT2 families) (Hansen et al. 2012; Soto et al. 2019). \nInterestingly however, recently described Arabidopsis \nputative POFUT, O-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1 \n(AtOFT1), implicit in pollen tube penetration through \nthe stigma-style interface, was reported to diverge from \nthis pattern. Phylogenetic analysis of AtOFT1 has shown \nthat it exhibits a relatively high sequence identity to \nmembers of POFUT1 family, compared to other putative \nPOFUTs found in Arabidopsis (Smith et al. 2018). \nAs in silico analysis suggests that AtGTLP may also be \npotentially related to metazoan POFUTs, the possibility \nthat yet uncharacterized families of POFUTs, more \nrelated to metazoan POFUTs than previously reported \nPOFUTs, exist in Arabidopsis genome is worth further \nexaminations.\nIn our subcellular localization study, we found \nthat AtGTLP localizes mainly to trans-Golgi. Human \nPOFUT1 and POFUT2 localize to the ER (Luo and \nHaltiwanger 2005; Luo et al. 2006), where the O-\nglycosylation process for most proteins starts (Stanley \n2011). Arabidopsis POFUT with confirmed activity, \nSPINDY, is known to be active in nucleus/cytoplasm \n(Bi et al. 2023; Kumar et al. 2023; Zentella et al. 2023). \nHowever, it is the only POFUT discovered thus far with \nthis subcellular localization (Sun 2021). On the other \nhand, putative Arabidopsis POFUTs, such as AtOFT1 \n(Robichaux et al. 2023; Smith et al. 2018), as well as \nFRIABLE1 (Neumetzler et al. 2012) and ESMERALDA1 \n(Verger et al. 2016) were experimentally shown to \nlocalize to Golgi.

One \ntype of macromolecules, which contain fucose are \npectic polysaccharides\u2014RG-I and RG-II. At present, \nbiosynthesis of RG-I and RG-II is not fully understood, \nand no specific fucosyltransferase, which could be linked \nto synthesis of RG-I and RG-II side chains, has been \nidentified (Soto et al. 2019; Voxeur et al. 2012), suggesting \nthat yet uncharacterized type of fucosyltransferase is \npresent in plants and responsible for this process.\nGTs are a diverse family of enzymes and very few \nmembers of FUT family in Arabidopsis has been \nwell-characterized thus far. Despite the fact that \ncharacteristics of AtGTLP, such as its trans-Golgi \nlocalization, type II topology and the presence of O-\nFUT-like conserved domain, seem to agree with the \nassumption that it is a member of the glycosyltransferase \nfamily, the data currently available are not enough to \nconclusively state that AtGTLP is a GT or a type of FUT, \nprecisely. Under standard growth conditions, atgtlp\u2212/\u2212 \nsingle mutant displayed phenotype indistinguishable \nfrom Col-0 plants and one possible explanation for this \nresult is that AtGTLP and related proteins with high \namino acid sequence similarity to AtGTLP might have \nredundant functions. Protein At4g12700, which shows a \nvery high sequence similarity to AtGTLP is one potential \ncandidate. Further research is needed to confirm the \npresence of glycosyltransferase/fucosyltranferase activity, \nas well as the biological role of AtGTLP.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank K.

Bassham1,2,3*\nAbstract\nBackground: The movement of plant roots within the soil is key to their ability to interact with the environment\nand maximize anchorage and nutrient acquisition. Directional growth of roots occurs by a combination of sensing\nexternal cues, hormonal signaling and cytoskeletal changes in the root cells. Roots growing on slanted,\nimpenetrable growth medium display a characteristic waving and skewing, and mutants with deviations in these\nphenotypes assist in identifying genes required for root movement. Our study identifies a role for a trans-Golgi\nnetwork-localized protein in root skewing.\nResults: We found that Arabidopsis thaliana TNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), a putative tethering\nfactor localized at the trans-Golgi network, affects root skewing. tno1 knockout mutants display enhanced root\nskewing and epidermal cell file rotation. Skewing of tno1 roots increases upon microtubule stabilization, but is\ninsensitive to microtubule destabilization. Microtubule destabilization leads to severe defects in cell morphology in\ntno1 seedlings. Microtubule array orientation is unaffected in the mutant roots, suggesting that the increase in cell\nfile rotation is independent of the orientation of microtubule arrays.\nConclusions: We conclude that TNO1 modulates root skewing in a mechanism that is dependent on microtubules\nbut is not linked to disruption of the orientation of microtubule arrays. In addition, TNO1 is required for\nmaintenance of cell morphology in mature regions of roots and the base of hypocotyls. The TGN-localized SNARE\nmachinery might therefore be important for appropriate epidermal cell file rotation and cell expansion during root\ngrowth.\nKeywords: trans-Golgi network, Root movement, Cell file rotation, Tethering factor, Microtubules\nBackground\nEstablishment of the root system of a plant is crucial for\nefficient anchorage and nutrient acquisition. Root devel-\nopment and architecture are well-studied [1] but our\nunderstanding of how roots interact with soil components\nis still incomplete. This is due in part to the difficulty of\nvisualizing roots as they move into the soil, although\nrecent developments such as the GLO-Roots platform aid\nin imaging this process [2, 3]. Root growth into the sub-\nstratum presents multiple cues to the root tip such as\nmechanical obstacles, moisture and nutrient gradients.\nThese cues are integrated and then signal downstream\nprocesses involving hormonal pathways and cell expan-\nsion [4]. This leads to a cumulative physiological response\ndriving\nroot\nmovement\nand\nestablishing\nthe\nroot\narchitecture.\nStudying and simulating root movement and direc-\ntional growth in the laboratory on synthetic growth\nmedia has revealed distinct movement types, and some\nof the genes and pathways that control them [4]. Roots\nof Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings display various growth\nbehaviors depending on external conditions. When em-\nbedded in a homogeneous medium (penetrable agar),\nroots grow downward in response to gravity and show\nminimal deviation from the gravity vector. By contrast,\nwhen roots are subjected to multiple directional cues,\ncomplicated growth patterns occur [5].

This arises due to a com-\nbination of touch [6], gravitropism [7], circumnutation\n[5], and physical interaction between the root tip and\nthe growth medium [8].\nSkewing and waving roots display a characteristic\ntwisting of epidermal cell files along the root, referred to\nas cell file rotation (CFR). When roots of Arabidopsis\nseedlings skew and wave, the succession of sinusoidal\nwaves alternate between left-handed and right-handed\nCFRs, which correlates with their rightward and leftward\nmovement respectively [6, 7]. According to Rutherford\nand Masson (1996), skewing is described as rightward or\nleftward when viewed from the back of the plate [7]\nwhile handedness of the CFR is defined as left-handed\nor right-handed when viewing the axis of the root point-\ning shootwards. Roots of Arabidopsis grown on a\nslanted, hard medium exhibit a dominant left-handed\nrotation around the growth axis resulting in a predomin-\nantly counterclockwise/left-handed epidermal CFR. This\nusually corresponds to a rightward skewing when seen\nfrom the back of the plate [7, 9, 10]. CFR also typically\ncorrelates with an oblique microtubule (MT) array\norientation in the twisting cell files, although exceptions\ndo exist [11].\nMultiple factors such as external cues (e.g. moisture,\nlight or gravity), hormonal pathways, and cytoskeletal and\ncell wall dynamics influence the direction of root growth\n[4]. External cues signal changes in hormone signaling\npathways, including auxin [12\u201314], ethylene [8, 15], cyto-\nkinin [16] and brassinosteroid pathways [17]. Downstream\nof hormonal and environmental perception, changes in\nthe cytoskeleton and in cell wall deposition patterns\nmodulate cell division and cell expansion dynamics, thus\nmediating root movements. Defects in tubulin structure\nor activity or in MT-associated proteins result in altered\nMT dynamics and array orientation. This then leads to\nchanges in cell expansion and affects CFR and skewing\n[18, 19]. Cell wall properties and the trafficking of cell wall\ncomponents to the plasma membrane are key to root\nelongation and movement as inferred from the altered\nroot movements observed in mutants defective in cellu-\nlose deposition, wall-anchored proteins or crosslinking of\ncell wall components [20\u201322].\nSorting of cell wall components occurs at the trans-\nGolgi network (TGN), a tubulo-vesicular organelle that\nmatures from the two or three trans- most cisternae of\nthe Golgi [23]. It acts as an early endosome, receiving\nendocytosed cargo as well as directing vacuolar and\nsecretory traffic, with distinct subdomains that function in\nvarious trafficking routes [24\u201330]. Specific membrane\nfusion factors called SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide\u2013\nsensitive factor attachment protein receptors) maintain\nvesicle trafficking fidelity and cargo sorting within cells\n[31]. The TGN-localized SYP4 (41/42/43) SNARE family\nis required for multiple transport pathways that in turn\nregulate auxin homeostasis and disease resistance [30].\nSYP61, another TGN-localized SNARE that interacts with\nSYP41, functions in vacuolar trafficking and secretion of\ncell wall enzymes such as cellulose synthase and pectin-\npolysaccharide-modifying protein. This indicates a role for\nSYP61 in trafficking of cell wall components and enzymes\nfor their synthesis and modification [32\u201334]. TNO1\n(TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein) is a TGN-\nlocalized coiled-coil protein that interacts with the SYP41\nSNARE machinery. Mutant plants lacking TNO1 (tno1)\npartially mis-sort vacuolar cargo, mis-localize SYP61 and\ndisplay altered TGN dynamics and slower gravitropic\nresponses [35, 36].\nTrafficking at the TGN plays a role in auxin responses,\ntrafficking of cell wall components, and cell expansion,\nall of which are important for root growth and move-\nment. In addition, gravitropic bending is delayed in tno1\nroots, suggesting defects in directional growth of roots.\nWe therefore investigated a potential function for TNO1\nin root movement. We report here that TNO1 acts as a\nnegative regulator of root skewing, since tno1 mutant\nroots have enhanced skewing which also correlates with\nan enhanced CFR.\nMethods\nPlant material and growth conditions\nArabidopsis thaliana Col-0 (wild-type, WT) and tno1\nknockout mutant (SALK_112503) were obtained from\nthe Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center; the comple-\nmented tno1 mutant was generated previously in our\nlaboratory [35]. Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized\nin 33% bleach, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min,\nrinsed 5 times with sterile water and kept in the dark at\n4 \u00b0C for at least 2 days before being subjected to the root\nskewing and waving assays or drug sensitivity assays\ndescribed below. Arabidopsis hypocotyls were analyzed\nby plating sterilized seeds on 0.5X solid Murashige-\nSkoog (MS) medium [(Murashige-Skoog vitamin and salt\nmixture, Caisson, MSPA0910] with 1% sucrose, 2.4 mM\nMES (pH 5.7), and 0.8% (w/v) Phytoblend agar (Caisson,\nPTP01) and growing vertically at 22 \u00b0C in the dark.\nRoot skewing and waving assays\nSkewing and waving assays were performed as described\n[7, 37]. Arabidopsis plants were grown at 22 \u00b0C in long-\nday conditions (16 h light) on 0.5X solid Murashige-\nSkoog (MS) medium (Murashige-Skoog vitamin and salt\nmixture, Caisson, MSPA0910) with 1% sucrose, 2.4 mM\nMES (pH 5.7), and 1.5% (w/v) Phytoblend agar (Caisson,\nPTP01). Seedlings were grown vertically for 3 days after\nRoy and Bassham BMC Plant Biology  (2017) 17:73 \nPage 2 of 12\nwhich the root tip position was marked. The plates were\nthen slanted backwards, 30o to the vertical, and grown\nfor another 4 days. Images of the roots were acquired\nfrom the back of the plate using a Nikon SMZ1000 light\nmicroscope equipped with a Nikon S10 CoolPix camera.\nAnalysis of root parameters was performed using Image\nJ [38]. Root tip deviations to the right from the back of\nthe plate were considered positive while deviations to\nthe left were considered negative.\nRoot\nmorphometric\nanalyses\nwere\nperformed\nas\ndescribed [39]. Images of skewing/waving roots were\nanalyzed with the ImageJ software [38] for measuring\nroot tip abscissa (Lx) and length of the root (L) followed\nby calculation of horizontal growth indices (Lx/L).\nDrug sensitivity assays\nSeedlings were grown vertically on plates containing\neither taxol (Paclitaxel, Sigma Cat #T7191) or propyza-\nmide (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat #45645) at the indicated\nconcentrations for 5 days and skewing angles of roots\nwere determined. Dark grown hypocotyl cell phenotypes\nwere analyzed by placing 7-day-old hypocotyls on the\nsurface of warm 3% low melting point agarose on a slide\n[40] and then imaging the imprints with a Zeiss\nAxioplan II light microscope.\nCell file rotation analysis and propidium iodide staining\nThe root surface of Arabidopsis seedlings was visualized\nusing a Zeiss macro-zoom microscope at the Microscopy\nand NanoImaging facility, Iowa State University. Alter-\nnatively, roots were stained with propidium iodide\n(ThermoFisher Scientific Cat #P3566). Seedlings were\ndipped in a working aqueous solution (10 \u03bcg/ml) of\npropidium iodide for 1 min and then washed twice by\ndipping in petri dishes filled with water for 30 s. The\nroots were mounted in water and visualized using a\nLeica confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5;\nLeica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Con-\nfocal and Multiphoton Facility. Excitation and emission\nwavelengths were 488 nm and 617 nm respectively.\nLaser power, scan frequency and line averaging were\noptimized and kept constant between samples and\nreplicates. CFR angles of the roots were calculated as\ndescribed [7, 41] using ImageJ [38].\nImmunostaining and analysis of microtubules\nFive-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on slanted\nmedium were fixed and immunostained as described\n[42]. Mouse anti-\u03b1- tubulin antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich,\nCat #T6074), diluted 1:100, were used for immunolabel-\ning of MTs followed by AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat\nanti-mouse IgG (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat #A11029)\nas a secondary antibody, diluted 1:500. Cells within the\nelongation zone were imaged by confocal microscopy\nwith a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica\nSP5; Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University\nConfocal and Multiphoton Facility, using a 40X (1.25\nNA) or 63X (1.4 NA) Leica oil immersion objective.\nExcitation and emission wavelengths were 488 nm and\n507 nm. Laser power, scan frequency and line averaging\nwere optimized and kept constant between samples and\nreplicates. Confocal images were analyzed with the freely\navailable\nsoftware\npackage\nMicroFilament\nAnalyzer\n(MFA) [43], and data was displayed as circular plots as\ngenerated by the software. MT angles generated by the\nsoftware were classified into three classes, 0 to 10, 11 to\n30 and 31 to 90 degrees using Microsoft Excel and used\nfor subsequent analysis.\nResults\nLoss of TNO1 results in exaggerated root skewing\nMutants lacking TNO1 have normal root elongation,\nbut show a lag in root gravitropic bending upon gravisti-\nmulation [36]. Positive gravitropism is a key component\ndriving root waving and skewing, and hence we hypothe-\nsized that TNO1 might play a role in these processes.\nTo test this hypothesis, 3-day-old seedlings were\ngrown vertically on the surface of hard agar medium\n(1.5% agar), the plates tipped over by 30o, and the seed-\nlings allowed to grow for an additional 4 days (Fig. 1a).\nThe slant forces the root tip to press against the impene-\ntrable medium due to positive gravitropism. As the root\nfails to penetrate the medium, cell expansion and\ncircumnutation drive the root to the side and this alter-\nnates between rightward and leftward corrective devia-\ntions resulting in characteristic waving and skewing\nresponses [4, 7]. tno1 mutant roots (KO) formed sinus-\noidal wave-like growth patterns similar to WT (Col-0)\nroots but had an exaggerated rightward skew compared\nto the WT roots, when seen from the back of the plate\n(Fig. 1b). tno1 mutants complemented with transgenic\nTNO1 under the control of its own promoter (COM)\n[35] had reduced skewing compared to the mutants and\nwere similar to the WT roots (Fig. 1b). Root images\nwere analyzed using ImageJ [38] and quantified for devi-\nation of the root tips from their position at the time of\nslant initiation (\u03b2) (Fig. 1c) [7, 39]. tno1 mutants had a\nhigher angle of deviation than the WT or complemented\nroots (Fig. 1d; P < 0.05). To confirm the difference in\nphenotype,\nanother\nmorphometric\nparameter,\nthe\nhorizontal growth index (HGI), was calculated for the\nskewing roots. HGI is the ratio of the root tip abscissa\n(Lx) and length of the root (L) (Fig. 1c) and is a sensitive\nand robust parameter to quantify lateral directions of\ngrowth, independent of root shape [39]. Root tips\nskewed to the right yield positive Lx values and negative\nvalues when roots skew left. A positive Lx results in a\npositive HGI value, which then signifies a rightward\nRoy and Bassham BMC Plant Biology  (2017) 17:73 \nPage 3 of 12\ndeviation while a negative value suggests leftward devi-\nation [39]. tno1 roots had a significantly higher HGI\nthan WT and complemented lines (Fig. 1e; P < 0.05),\nconfirming that the tno1 mutants do indeed have an in-\ncreased rightward deviation from the vertical.\nSkewing tno1 roots display enhanced root epidermal cell\nfile rotation (CFR)\nThe cellular basis for CFR is still not completely under-\nstood, but has been proposed to be a result of the circum-\nnutation of the root tip [20]. Circumnutation is dependent\non an internal mechanism that results in an elliptical or cir-\ncular trajectory around an imaginary axis of growth [44].\nThe helical pattern of cell division at the root tip has been\nhypothesized to be the basis for epidermal CFR [6, 10, 37].\nThe characteristic spiral cell division patterns of the outer\ncircle of meristematic cells in the root apex causes a spiral-\ning of the cell files, thus resulting in CFR formation [45],\nalthough this fails to explain why CFR initiates at the base\nof the elongation zone, away from the site of initial cell\ndivisions. A lag in anisotropic expansion rates between the\nepidermal and the inner cell layers can also cause a twisting\nof the cell files to compensate for stresses and strains that\nmight otherwise cause tissue breakage [9]. CFR, usually\npreceding root bending and skewing [41], is visible at the\nbase of the elongation zone of skewing roots. Rightward-\nskewing mutants usually display a dominant left-handed\nCFR [4, 11]. We therefore hypothesized that the enhanced\nrightward skewing in the tno1 mutants would correlate\nwith an increase in left-handed CFR.\nMicroscopic analysis of mutant roots showed a marked\nleft-handed epidermal CFR initiating in the root elongation\nzone (black arrow, Fig. 2a) while WT and complemented\nroots mainly have a vertical arrangement of cell files with a\nlack of distinct CFR in this region (Fig. 2a). Confocal im-\naging of propidium iodide-stained roots revealed a distinct-\nive left-handed CFR with a higher twist in the elongation\nzone of tno1 lines compared to the WT and complemented\nlines (Fig. 2b). Images were analyzed with ImageJ to quan-\ntify the left-handed twist of the cell files relative to the lon-\ngitudinal axis of the root. The tno1 CFRs were significantly\nhigher (P < 0.01) than the WT and complemented root\nCFRs (Fig. 2c). This may explain the enhanced skew of the\nmutant roots, since the increased left-handed twist might\ncause larger deviations from the axis of growth.\nSkewing of tno1 roots is enhanced upon MT stabilization\nby taxol\nCFR can be caused directly by altered cortical MT\norganization, which influences anisotropic expansion as\nFig. 1 Loss of TNO1 protein function causes increased rightward root skewing. a Side view of the setup for the root skewing assay on growth\nmedium solidified with 1.5% agar. Seedlings were grown vertically for 3 days in long day (LD) conditions, after which the root tip position was\nmarked.

Several mutants defective in MT stability,\norganization and dynamics have enhanced right- or left-\nward skewing, with a dominant left or right-handed CFR\nrespectively [18]. Many, but not all, also display a hand-\nedness of the cortical MT arrays that is opposite to the\nCFR handedness of the elongation zone of the roots.\nSome mutants defective in MT-interacting proteins\nshow right-handed CFR, skew to the left, and display\nleft-handed helical cortical MT arrays in the elongation\nzone [48, 49], while others have skewing defects but\nnormal transverse MT array orientation in the root\nelongation zone. This suggests that the relationship\nbetween MT dynamics, orientation, and skewing is com-\nplex. We hypothesized that the enhanced skewing and\nCFR in tno1 mutants might also be due to changes in\ncortical MT array organization or dynamics. TNO1 is lo-\ncalized to the TGN, and this hypothesis receives support\nfrom a recent study in which a TGN-localized protein\nwas shown to activate a kinesin and be involved in root\nskewing and gravitropism, linking MTs and the TGN in\nthe root skewing process [50].\nThe MT-stabilizing chemical taxol causes MT bundling\nand enhances rightward skewing in WT roots [9, 51].\nWhen grown vertically on increasing concentrations of\ntaxol (Fig. 3a), tno1 roots showed significantly higher\nrightward skewing than the WT and complemented lines\n(Fig. 3a, b). The percentage increase in the skewing angle\nof the mutant roots from 0 \u03bcM to 0.2 \u03bcM taxol is signifi-\ncantly higher (P < 0.05) than in the WT and complemen-\nted line roots (Fig. 3c). We hypothesized that this increase\nin skewing was due to an increase in the left-handed twist\nof the roots. Analysis of confocal images of propidium\niodide stained roots in the presence of 0.2 \u03bcM taxol re-\nveals a larger left-handed CFR in the tno1 roots compared\nto WT and complemented lines (Fig. 3d, e). The pheno-\ntype is reflective of the effect of taxol on the root growth\nrather than the effect of a slanted substratum, since the\ndrug assay is conducted on vertically-oriented plates.\nThese results suggest that MT stabilization exaggerates\nthe root skewing and CFR phenotype of the tno1 mutants.\nEffect of MT destabilization by propyzamide (PPD) on\nroot skewing in tno1 mutants\nThe MT-destabilizing chemical propyzamide (PPD) also\nenhances rightward skewing in WT seedlings [9]. Since\nthe effect of MT stabilization on root skewing in tno1\nseedlings suggests a MT-based role for TNO1 in root\nmovement, we tested the effect of PPD on root skewing in\nthe tno1 mutant. WT and complemented roots showed a\nslight increase in rightward skew at 1 \u03bcM PPD and a\nmarked increase at 3 \u03bcM PPD. Surprisingly, skewing of\ntno1 mutant roots was insensitive to PPD (Fig. 4a, b). The\npercentage increase in skewing observed for WT and\ncomplemented roots in the presence of PPD was signifi-\ncantly higher than in tno1 (Fig. 4c).

While the TNO1 transgene in the com-\nplemented lines is expressed under its native promoter\nand its overall expression levels are similar to that of the\nendogenous protein, position effects within the genome\nmay cause slight differences in expression pattern in\ndifferent cell types.\nWe hypothesized that the reduced skewing of tno1\nroots in the presence of PPD would correlate with a\nreduced\nCFR\nwhen\ncompared\nwith\nCFRs\nof\nPPD\ntreated-WT and complemented roots.

The mutant root epidermal cell files also\ndisplay considerable left-handed CFR, indistinguishable\nfrom WT and complemented lines (Fig. 4d, e). Hence,\nthe resistance of tno1 roots to PPD-induced skewing is\nindependent of PPD-induced CFR. To explain this\nobservation, we hypothesized that the PPD treatment\nmight have other effects on the mutant roots, including\neffects on root growth or morphology.

This\npoints to a possible defect in cell maturation or cell wall de-\nposition that could potentially interfere with the ability of\nthe tno1 roots to skew in the presence of PPD even as the\nCFR in the elongation zone continues to form nor-\nmally. It is possible that the defects in the mature\nzone of the PPD-treated tno1 roots could then affect\nhow the growing root interacts with the substrate,\nwhich would in turn affect root skewing.\nTo assess whether other organs and cell types in the\nmutant might also be sensitive to MT disruption by\nPPD, we analyzed agarose imprints of control and PPD-\ntreated dark-grown hypocotyls.

As observed in the skewing assay, the\ncomplemented lines were slightly more sensitive to PPD\nthan WT, which again may be due to position effects.\nCell elongation is initiated at the base of dark grown\nhypocotyls [52], and the loss of TNO1 may lead to an\nincreased susceptibility of this cell expansion process to\nMT destabilization by PPD. Treatment with low concen-\ntrations of PPD (such as 2 \u03bcM) has been reported to\ncause a decrease in the dynamic instability of cortical\nMTs, leading to more static MTs that spend more time\nin the paused state compared to untreated cells [53].\nOur results suggest that the disruption of MT dynamics\nby PPD has a more adverse effect on tno1 roots than\nWT. This could be manifest as defects in MT-array\norganization, anisotropic expansion, or both, resulting in\nthe observed disruption in cell morphology in tno1.\nThe orientation of MT arrays in the elongating cells of\nskewing tno1 roots is not affected\nMT arrays in elongation zones of roots are usually ar-\nranged in a transverse orientation to facilitate aniso-\ntropic expansion. Skewing roots of some mutants with\nmarked CFRs have distinct oblique arrays of MTs, with\nthe handedness of a MT array opposite to that of CFR\n[18]. Strong correlations have also been observed be-\ntween angle of skewing and pitch of the MT arrays [11].\nMany mutants that are defective in MT-associated\nprocesses have a change in the pitch of MT arrays asso-\nciated with a corresponding change in CFR. However,\nsome mutants with enhanced CFR show no obliqueness\nof the MT array, but rather have transverse arrange-\nments similar to the central elongation zone cells of the\nWT roots. For example, the sku6 mutant maintains a\ntransverse alignment of MT arrays despite its left-\nhanded CFR [9, 54] while the mor1\u20131 mutant, impaired\nin MT polymerization, also displays a left-handed CFR\nbut no bias in MT array orientation [55]. These mutant\nphenotypes suggest that additional factors can also be\nresponsible for a change in CFR, apart from the MT\narray orientation.\nWe hypothesized that the dominant left-handed CFR\nin the tno1 roots would correspond to a right-handed\nMT array in the epidermal cells of the elongation zone\ncompared to WT roots. Four-day-old chemically fixed\nWT and tno1 roots, grown on a slanted impenetrable\nmedium, were immunostained with tubulin antibodies\n[42] to detect MTs and imaged by confocal microscopy.\nThe MT arrays of epidermal cells in the mutant roots\ndid not show any distinct handedness or change in pitch\ncompared to WT epidermal MT arrays (Fig. 6a). Quanti-\ntative analyses on collected images were performed util-\nizing the MATLAB software package MicroFilament\nAnalyzer [43] to allow comparison of MT orientation in\nmultiple images from different biological replicates. The\nrepresentative circular output graphs from the analyses\nsuggest a mainly transverse orientation of the MTs in\nthe elongation zone of both WT and tno1 roots (blue\nFig. 5 Effect of 3 \u03bcM propyzamide (PPD) on cell morphology of the mature region of the root and the base of the hypocotyl. a Representative\nimage of propidium iodide-stained mature zone of WT, KO and COM roots grown on solvent as a control or 3 \u03bcM PPD for 7 days, imaged with a\nconfocal microscope.

To assess\nwhether a difference in the percentage of oblique MTs\nbetween the WT and mutant might explain the higher\nCFR in the mutants, MT angles of root cells from WT\nand tno1 roots were classified into three classes, 0 to 10,\n11 to 30 and 31 to 90 degrees (Fig. 6c). No significant\ndifference was found in the percentage of MTs in each\nclass between the WT and mutant. Thus we conclude\nthat tno1 mutants have normal transverse MT arrays in\nthe skewing roots, suggesting that an alternative mech-\nanism must be responsible for the change in CFR.\nDiscussion\nTNO1 plays important roles in post-Golgi trafficking,\ngravitropism and auxin transport-dependent processes.\nHere we demonstrate that TNO1 is required for root\nskewing and CFR formation. Skewing of tno1 mutant\nroots increased to a greater extent upon MT stabilization\nby taxol when compared to WT roots but was resistant\nto MT destabilization by PPD. This led us to postulate a\nrole for TNO1 in MT-dependent processes, although\nMT destabilizing agents have also been reported to in-\nduce left-handed CFR without affecting MT arrays [53].\nIn roots, MT arrays transition from a disordered state in\nthe meristematic zone to a transverse orientation in the\nelongation zone, and this organization is important for\nfacilitating rapid anisotropic growth [42]. Defects in\ntubulin structure/activity and in MT-associated proteins\ncan result in oblique MT arrays in the central elongation\nzone of roots. Oblique MT orientation in elongating\ncells causes cells to expand at an angle to the vertical,\nleading to CFR and root skewing [4, 20, 56, 57]. Skewing\nroots of tno1 do not show an oblique MT orientation in\nthe elongation zone but rather a transverse one. This\nsuggests that the root movement phenotype in tno1\nmutants arises independent of the organization of MT\narrays in the root elongation zone, although dependent\non MT dynamics. It is possible that, despite its normal\norientation, the cortical MT array in tno1 roots might be\ncompromised in restructuring or function as the root\nnavigates a complex trajectory during skewing. The loss\nof TNO1 could potentially also affect the function of a\nMT-associated protein such as a kinesin; as an example,\na TGN-localized kinesin-binding separase has recently\nbeen reported to affect root skewing [50].\nCertain root skewing mutants have transverse MT\narrays or a lack of directional bias in the MT arrays in the\nroot elongation zone but have a distinct CFR [54, 58, 59].\nFig. 6 The orientation of MT arrays in the elongating cells of skewing mutant roots is not affected. a Representative confocal images of the cortical\nmicrotubule array of elongating cells of 5-day-old Arabidopsis roots grown on slanted medium, immunostained with anti-\u03b1- tubulin.

Error bars indicate standard errors\nRoy and Bassham BMC Plant Biology  (2017) 17:73 \nPage 9 of 12\nMoreover, CFR can still occur upon MT disruption with\nMT destabilizing agents such as oryzalin and PPD [53].\nThis suggests that the MT array is not the only factor in-\nvolved in generating CFR. Owing to anomalies such as\nthese, Wasteneys (2004) proposed that CFR could arise\ndue to torsional handedness inherent to roots, and the\ncorrelation between CFR and MT array orientations could\nresult from signaling between the MT array and cell wall\nmachinery. Thus, CFR could arise from the effect of MT\narrays on anisotropic expansion in the elongation zone or,\nalternatively, from the effect of cellulose microfibrils on\nMT array alignment at the plasma membrane [46, 47].\nMutants that affect CFR formation but not MT array\norientation in the elongation zone support this model, in-\ncluding mutants defective in regulation of anisotropic cell\nexpansion [20, 54]. Based on this model, and consistent\nwith the cell morphology phenotypes observed in the\npresence of PPD, TNO1 might be important for the aniso-\ntropic cell expansion process or in cell wall trafficking\ndynamics.\nA lag in the expansion rates of internal cell types com-\npared to the epidermal cells may cause roots to skew to\nprevent mechanical shearing [9, 57]. The mature root cells\nand hypocotyls of tno1 seedlings treated with PPD showed\nmarked disruption of cell morphology, suggesting a role\nfor TNO1 in the cell maturation or expansion process.\nThis model would also explain why tno1 roots skew des-\npite the transverse MT arrays in the epidermal cells of the\nroot elongation zone. Vertically-grown tno1 seedlings have\nsimilar root lengths to WT seedlings, suggesting normal\ncell expansion during vertical growth. Thus TNO1 might\nbe required specifically for cell expansion during deviation\nof roots from their growth trajectory.\nDuring cell expansion and cellulose deposition, the\ncellulose synthase complex traffics via the TGN [60, 61].\nThe observed defects in cell morphology and expansion\ncould be due to the role of TNO1 in proper localization\nof the TGN-localized Q-SNARE SYP61 [31, 32]. Prote-\nomic analysis of SYP61-containing vesicles [34] revealed\nthe presence of cellulose synthase complex subunits,\nsuggesting a role in trafficking of cellulose synthase\nsubunits, which then drives cellulose deposition. MT\narray dynamics modulate the deposition of cellulose mi-\ncrofibrils in expanding cells since cellulose synthase runs\nparallel to the MT array, with CELLULOSE SYNTHASE\nINTERACTIVE1 acting as a link between the cellulose\nsynthase machinery and cortical MTs [62\u201365]. MTs also\nregulate exocytosis of vesicles containing cellulose syn-\nthase complex subunits or complex-associated proteins\nsuch as KOR1 and CSI1 [66\u201368]. Disrupting MT arrays\ntherefore\naffects\ncellulose synthesis,\ndeposition\nand\norientation, while conversely, inhibiting cellulose syn-\nthase activity causes defects in MT arrays [69, 70], which\ncan potentially affect directional growth patterns [18].\nInhibitors of cellulose synthase trafficking such as CES-\nTRIN cause MT instability and reduced cellulose content,\nand increase SYP61 and cellulose synthase co-localization\n[68]. Since CESTRIN does not affect the bulk secretory and\nendocytic routes, the SYP61-decorated domain of the TGN\nand its associated proteins such as TNO1 seem to be cru-\ncial for cellulose deposition and, indirectly, MT stability.\nHowever, mutations in cellulose synthase components\n(rsw1\u20131, any1) or treatment with cellulose synthase inhibi-\ntors does not induce CFR [58, 71, 72]. Moreover, Sugimoto\n(2003) also reports that a cellulose synthase mutant can\nundergo CFR even when the MTs are compromised [58].\nTrafficking of other proteins required for cell expansion\nand root movement might also be disrupted in tno1 mu-\ntants. For example, SKU5 is required for enzymatic reac-\ntions at the cell wall, and mutants lacking this protein show\nenhanced root skewing possibly due to altered cell wall\ncomposition during cell expansion [20]. Our observations\nsuggest that CFR formation involves complex interactions\nand is not simply dependent on MT array and cellulose de-\nposition patterns. Current models of the mechanisms of\nhelical growth have been challenged by studies on tortifo-\nlia2 mutants, in which individual freely growing trichomes\ntwist. These mutants therefore uncouple cell division pat-\nterns and tissue strain from twisting and suggest that indi-\nvidual twisting of cells can translate to higher-order organ\ntwisting [73]. Understanding the exact role of TNO1 at the\nTGN and the mechanism by which it modulates CFR and\nskewing will thus be a challenge.\nOur results suggest that TNO1 and the TGN play a\nkey role in CFR and root movement, adding another\ncomponent to the network controlling root movement.\nFurther experiments are necessary to test the exact role\nof TNO1 and its interacting partners in regulating root\nskewing and CFR formation. Future studies investigating\nTNO1\u2019s role in cellulose synthase trafficking, MT stabil-\nity and cell expansion dynamics in skewing roots will\nincrease our understanding of the function of TNO1.\nSince TNO1 affects auxin transport [36], our study now\npoints to the possibility of an impact of TNO1 on auxin\ntransport, MT dynamics and cell wall trafficking at the\nTGN. Discovering TNO1\u2019s precise role will help in eluci-\ndation of the function of the TGN SNARE machinery in\nplant growth and morphogenesis.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, we have discovered a role for a TGN-\nlocalized protein in root skewing on the surface of impene-\ntrable media. This adds to the growing list of endogenous\nfactors that aid root movement. Our data, alongside prior\ninvestigations, also suggest a possible link between TNO1,\nauxin-dependent and MT-associated processes. A better\nunderstanding of these mechanisms can lead to informa-\ntion that can be used to manipulate root growth and\nRoy and Bassham BMC Plant Biology  (2017) 17:73 \nPage 10 of 12\ndevelopment patterns in various soil conditions and\nimprove overall root architecture.

Blaber1,2, Natalya Dvorochkin1, Chialing Lee1, Joshua S. Alwood1, Rukhsana Yousuf1,\nPiero Pianetta3, Ruth K. Globus1, Brendan P. Burns2, Eduardo A. C.

Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts,\nosteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and\nunloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis,\nand cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16-\nweek-old female C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the\npelvis by mCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of 6.29%, and bone thickness of 11.91%. TRAP-positive\nosteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170% (p = 0.004), indicating osteoclastic bone\ndegeneration. High-resolution X-ray nanoCT studies revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, including increases in cross-\nsectional area (+17%, p = 0.022), perimeter (+14%, p = 0.008), and canalicular diameter (+6%, p = 0.037). Expression of matrix\nmetalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 3, and 10 in bone, as measured by RT-qPCR, was also up-regulated in microgravity (+12.94,\n+2.98 and +16.85 fold respectively, p,0.01), with MMP10 localized to osteocytes, and consistent with induction of\nosteocytic osteolysis. Furthermore, expression of CDKN1a/p21 in bone increased 3.31 fold (p,0.01), and was localized to\nosteoblasts, possibly inhibiting the cell cycle during tissue regeneration as well as conferring apoptosis resistance to these\ncells. Finally the apoptosis inducer Trp53 was down-regulated by 21.54 fold (p,0.01), possibly associated with the\nquiescent survival-promoting function of CDKN1a/p21. In conclusion, our findings identify the pelvic and femoral region of\nthe mouse skeleton as an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity, and indicate that this loss is not limited to\nosteoclastic degradation. Therefore, this study offers new evidence for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis, and\nCDKN1a/p21-mediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest.\nCitation: Blaber EA, Dvorochkin N, Lee C, Alwood JS, Yousuf R, et al.

Forces generated by gravity such as\nhydrostatic pressure, stretch, and fluid shear are well known to\npromote normal tissue growth and repair mechanisms. Converse-\nly, during spaceflight, gravity-generated forces are absent and the\nmechanical stimulation of tissues is greatly diminished. Direct and\nimmediate physiological responses to microgravity-induced me-\nchanical unloading include adaptive losses of bone [1,2,3,4,5,6]\nand muscle mass [7,8,9,10], and alterations in cardiovascular\nfunction [11,12,13,14]. Because of practical reasons, most space\nbiological animal research has focused on the short-term effects of\nspaceflight, and thus our understanding of long-term effects of\nmicrogravity exposure is very limited. However, it is likely that\nover long periods of time mechanical unloading in microgravity\nmay continue to affect tissue regenerative growth and repair,\nresulting in more widespread degenerative effects. Alternatively, it\nis also possible that cells and tissues may adapt to microgravity and\nreach a new homeostatic level appropriate for health maintenance\nunder reduced mechanical load conditions. Since normal tissue\nrepair and regeneration is dependent on the ability of adult stem\ncells to proliferate and differentiate, we have hypothesized that\nduring long-term spaceflight, the reduction in gravity mechano-\nstimulation may decrease regenerative proliferation and differen-\ntiation of tissue-specific adult stem cells. This in turn may have\nsignificant health consequences for multiple tissues throughout the\nbody, including bone.\nSpecifically for bone tissue, short-duration exposure to micro-\ngravity rapidly leads to alterations in bone mineral content,\ncellular dynamics, and gene expression patterns [15,16,17,18,19].\nThis is illustrated by a 1\u20132% loss of skeletal mineral in weight-\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org\n1\nApril 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61372\nbearing bones per month [17], which poses significant risks for\nlong-duration and interplanetary missions. Because bone remod-\neling homeostasis depends on tightly coupled mineral deposition\nand resorption [20,21], uncoupling of these processes in micro-\ngravity can cause increased and rapid bone resorption by\nosteoclasts,\nand\ndecreased\nbone\nformation\nby\nosteoblasts\n[17,18,22,23]. Increased osteoclast bone resorptive activity has\nbeen documented within the first several days of spaceflight [1,17]\nand may be reduced after a period of transition and adaptation to\nmicrogravity. However, of potentially more importance to long\nduration missions in microgravity is the reported reduction of bone\nformation by osteoblasts in growing rats [24,25,26], although, this\nresult has not been reproduced. In skeletally mature animals, this\nbone formation arrest may translate into an impairment of\nregenerative mechanisms, and therefore may be an important\nlong-term factor in spaceflight. Short of conducting long-term\nexperiments with rodents in space, analysis of the early cell cycle\narrest signaling pathways in osteogenic bone cells after short-term\nspaceflight is the most practical current approach to predict the\nlong-term degenerative effects of microgravity.\nTo perform this analysis we focused on the activation of cell\ncycle arrest and apoptosis pathways such as those mediated by the\ntumor and growth suppressor, p53, and the cell cycle inhibitor,\nCDKN1a/p21. P53 levels are reported to increase in the muscle of\nhindlimb-unloaded animals [27], potentially leading to cell cycle\narrest and/or apoptosis. Furthermore, p53 knockout mice have\npreserved trabecular bone volume following hindlimb-unloading\n[28] and generally, osteopetrotic bone, suggesting a role for the\np53-signaling pathway in the regulation of bone formation and\ndegradation\n[29,30].\nMore\nremarkably,\nthe\nCDKN1a/p21\nFigure 1. Micro-Computed Tomography (mCT) Analysis of Spaceflown Ischium. The ischium of the pelvis, shown in orange (A), was\nanalyzed using mCT (720 slices = 4.89 mm). The anatomical markers used for mCT analysis were (1) caudal apex of obturator foramen, (2) dorsal-most\npoint of the ventral ramus of ischium, and (3) the ischial tuberosity (A) (For full details on anatomical markers see [74]). The ischial cross-sectional\ngeometry (B) was analyzed by length (a), the width at the midpoint (b) and at 1/3 distance from the obturator foramen (c); and the bend angle (d).\nFlight samples (D) exhibited a more open cross-sectional geometry compared to the ground control (C), indicating a possible reduction in the pull\nforce applied to the bone. Ground control samples (F) also exhibited greater thickness (orange/red) then the flight samples (G), indicating a\nreduction in overall bone thickness in spaceflight samples.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0061372.g001\nBone Loss and p21 Expression in Microgravity\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org\n2\nApril 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61372\nknockout mouse has a viable phenotype with strong tissue\nregenerative abilities, such as limb re-growth, otherwise unheard\nof in adult mammals [31]. CDKN1a/p21 can be activated by\nenvironmental conditions such as oxidative stress and radiation, or\nbe part of normal cell cycle arrest mechanisms during cell\ndifferentiation. This phenotype suggests CDKN1a/p21 up-regu-\nlation in microgravity could explain broad regenerative deficits in\nspace.\nRecent studies have highlighted the potential role of osteocytes,\nterminally differentiated osteoblasts embedded within the miner-\nalized matrix, in the bone remodeling process, including in\nosteolysis of the lacunar surface for maintenance of calcium\nhomeostasis [32,33]. Results from light and electron microscopy of\nrat bone in a 22-day spaceflight experiment conducted in 1977\nindicated the appearance of lacunae changed to a \u2018\u2018wide\u2019\u2019\nmorphology that could contribute to bone loss in space [34].\nRecently, it was found that osteocytes acquired a more rounded\nshape after 91-days in microgravity during the Mice Drawer\nSystem experiment on ISS, albeit no statistical significance was\nobtained due to low n, and the authors did not conclude that\nosteocytic degradation of the lacunae surface was occurring [35].\nOn the other hand, osteocytic osteolysis was shown to be present\nin lactating mice but not activated in animals that were hindlimb\nunloaded for 4 weeks [36], leaving the potential role and\nimportance of osteocytic osteolysis during spaceflight an open\nquestion.\nTo address the limited understanding of cellular and molecular\nmechanisms underlying bone degeneration in space following the\ninitial osteoclastic activation, we focused on the processes related\nto osteoblastic and osteocytic activities. We hypothesized that\ndecreases in bone formation during spaceflight may be mediated\nby an inability of cells in osteogenic lineages to proliferate and\ndifferentiate normally due to reduced mechanical stimuli in\nmicrogravity. Finally, we also hypothesized that reduced mechan-\nostimulation\nof\nosteocytes\nin\nmicrogravity\nmay\nsignal\nthe\nactivation of osteocytic osteolysis of lacunar surfaces, with\naccompanying activation of matrix degradation pathways. Our\nspaceflight results presented here, suggest that the bone degener-\native effects of microgravity in skeletally mature mice go beyond\nrapid osteoclastic activation, affecting also cell cycle regulation in\nthe osteogenic lineage, and inducing osteocytic osteolysis.\nResults\nBody Mass of Animals Pre- and Post-Flight\nAll flight and ground control mice were observed to be in good\ncondition by veterinary examination immediately post-landing.\nNoticeably, the posture of space-flown mouse tails after landing\nwas vertical, indicating increased vestibular function in this group.\nThe average weight loss of space-flown mice was 2.0 g (29.1%,\nSD = 2.1 g, p = 0.013) significantly lower than pre-flight values,\nconsistent with tissue atrophy in microgravity, while synchronous\nground control mice only lost an average of 0.7 g (23.4%,\nSD = 0.9 g, p = 0.096) of their body weight relative to the\nbeginning of spaceflight. The difference in body weight loss\naverages for flight versus ground controls was not statistically\nsignificant\n(p = 0.143).\nFlight\nhabitats\nshowed\nutilization\nof\nresources on average of 10% less food, and 24% less water than\nsynchronous ground controls. However, food and water utilization\ndoes not account for actual consumption by mice, because\ndifferences may occur in food bar and water losses due to\ncrumbling and spillage in microgravity versus 1 g.\nSpaceflight Causes Osteoclast and Osteocyte-Mediated\nBone Loss in the Pelvic Region of Mice\nTo determine if bone loss occurred in microgravity, we\nexamined the bone structure and mineral density of the ischial\nregion of the pelvis using micro-computed tomography (mCT).\nSpecifically, we investigated the region from the caudal apex of the\nobturator foramen through to the ischial tuberosity (Fig. 1A) and\nfound that spaceflight resulted in a 6.23% decrease (p = 0.005) in\nbone volume fraction (BV/TV) and 11.91% decrease (p = 0.002)\nin overall bone thickness (Th) (Table 1). No difference was\nobserved in bone mineral density and total bone volumes\nmeasured (TV and BV) (Table 1). However, comparison of ischial\nstructural thickness of spaceflight versus ground control animals\nrevealed that bone from flight animals not only had a reduced\noverall thickness (Fig. 1F and G), but also showed changes in\nischial shape localized to the surface of the descending ramus of\nischium along the posterior margin of the obturator foramen\n(Fig. 1B). Analysis of cross-sectional slices revealed that the flight\nsamples had similar widths at two measured points (b/c ratio of\n1.09, Fig. 1D, Table 2), and a mean bend angle of 167u (deviating\n13u from linear, or less bent), compared to a width ratio of 1.39 in\nground control samples and a bend angle of 160u (deviating 20u\nfrom linear, or more bent) (Fig. 1C, Table 2), indicating that\nischial geometry changes in response to spaceflight. Furthermore,\nwhen we analyzed the thickness distribution of ischial cross-\nsectional slices, we found that flight animals exhibited a higher\npercentage of slices in the 0.007\u20130.128 mm range and a lower\npercentage of slices in the 0.129\u20130.291 mm range compared to\nground controls (Fig. 1E). The shift in thickness distribution to the\nleft in flight animals indicates an overall decrease in cross-sectional\nthickness throughout the ischium.\nIn order to study nanoscale aspects of bone loss following\nspaceflight, we used transmission x-ray microscopy to perform\n40 nm resolution nano-computed tomography (nanoCT). No\ndifference was found in bulk density of cortical bone between\nthe flight and ground controls (Fig. 2G), however, flight samples\nexhibited an enlargement in lacunae of 17% in cross sectional area\n(p = 0.022) and a 14% increase in lacunae perimeter (p = 0.008)\nwhen compared to ground controls (Fig. 2C\u2013D, E). In addition,\nlacunar circularity decreased in spaceflight by 9% (p = 0.037)\nindicating an increase in irregularly-shaped or elongated lacunae\n(Fig. 2A\u2013B, F). We also measured canalicular diameters in a\n15 mm perilacunar region and found an increase of 6% in\nspaceflight samples relative to ground controls (p = 0.037, Fig. 2F),\nindicating that the observed lacunar enlargement may extend\nthroughout these networks.\nTo characterize osteoclast bone resorbing activity during\nspaceflight, we used TRAP staining on sections of the proximal\nfemur. We found a 197% increase in osteoclast numbers in the\nbone surface of the trabecular region below the femoral head\ngrowth plate of flight samples (9.99 Oc/mm) compared to ground\ncontrols (3.36 Oc/mm) (p = 0.001, Fig. 3A\u2013C). The bone surface\ncovered by osteoclasts also increased by 154% in microgravity\n(25.4% in spaceflight versus 9.99% in ground controls, p = 0.004\nFig. 3D). Results for spaceflight induction of all TRAP-positive\nosteoclasts, independent of number of nuclei, were comparable.\nInterestingly, we also found an increase in the ratio of TRAP-\npositive osteocytes to total osteocytes in the femoral shaft of flight\nsamples compared to ground controls (34.43% and 20.94%\nrespectively, p = 0.004, Fig. 3D\u2013G). To determine if osteocyte\nsurvival was altered by microgravity we measured the number of\nempty lacunae in cortical bone from the proximal femur and\nfound no differences between ground and flight samples (10.6%\nand 10.0% empty lacunae respectively, p = 0.680, Fig. 3H).\nBone Loss and p21 Expression in Microgravity\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org\n3\nApril 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61372\nPyknotic nuclei were occasionally present in tissue surrounding\nbone, but were non-detectable in osteocytes. These results indicate\nroles for both osteoclastic and osteocytic bone degradation in\nmicrogravity.\nSpaceflight Induces MMP-Mediated Extracellular Matrix\nRemodeling in Bone\nAmong bone extracellular matrix related genes analyzed using\nRT-qPCR arrays we found small but statistically significant\nalterations in mRNA levels of collagens, and laminin subunits, but\nnot in fibronectin (Fig. 4A, Table 3). Among matrix metallopro-\nteinases, MMP 1, 3, and 10 showed significant up-regulation in\nflight samples compared to ground controls (12.94, 2.98, and\n16.85 fold respectively, p,0.05), while MMP inhibitors, TIMP 1,\n2, and 3, displayed no statistically significant change in gene\nexpression levels (Table 3). Several cell adhesion molecules;\nspecifically Cdh4, Cdh11, and Vcam1 were found to be up-\nregulated (2.46, 1.53, and 1.57 fold respectively, p,0.05), while\nItgal and Icam1 were found to be down-regulated (1.45 and 1.52\nfold respectively, p,0.05) (Fig. 4A, Table 3). These results indicate\nthat spaceflight promotes bone extracellular matrix degradation,\nwhile overall increase in expression of collagen, Tuft1, Sparc, and\nPhex (Table 3), may be related to increased bone mineralization\nfollowing degradation.\nTo determine the cellular location of MMP10 we conducted\nimmunohistochemical analysis on paraffin embedded sections of\nthe proximal femur. Results showed MMP10-positive staining in\nosteoblasts along the periosteal surface of the proximal femur in\nboth flight and ground controls. However, osteocytes embedded in\nthe bone matrix exhibited strong MMP10-positive staining in\nflight samples (Fig. 4C) but not in ground (Fig. 4B).\nSpaceflight Suppresses Pro-Osteogenic Growth and\nProliferation Gene Expression in Bone\nTo further study the effects of spaceflight in reducing bone\nformation, we investigated the expression of genes involved in\npromoting the cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation of\nthe osteoprogenitor lineage. A number of growth factors studied\nshowed altered gene expression levels by qPCR, including Bmp-4,\nTgf-b2, Gdf10, and Csf3 (21.99, 21.59, 21.43, 3.72 fold,\np,0.05) (Fig. 5A, Table 3). Furthermore, we found several genes\nassociated with cell growth and differentiation that were altered,\nincluding Egr1, Myod1, and Fgf3 which were down-regulated\n(22.30, 21.61, and 21.7 fold respectively, p,0.05), while Twist1\nand Fgf1 were up-regulated (1.80 and 1.53 fold respectively,\np,0.01) (Fig. 5A, Table 3). Results also indicate the alteration in\ngene expression of two transcription factors, Vitamin D receptor\n(Vdr) and Sox9, which exhibited a 2.80 fold up-regulation and\n2.28 fold down-regulation respectively (Fig. 5A, Table 3).\nSpaceflight Induces CDKN1a/p21 but Not Trp53/p53\nExpression in Bone\nIn addition to the effects we observed on osteogenesis promoting\ngene expression, we hypothesized that bone loss in space may also\nbe mediated by alterations in intracellular signaling cascades\nresulting in activation of the p53/p21 signaling pathways that\npromote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Analysis of spaceflight\nsamples by qPCR showed that mRNA expression levels of tumor\nsuppressor gene p53 (Trp/p53) were down-regulated 1.54 fold\nwhile CDKN1a/p21 exhibited a 3.31 fold up-regulation in\nresponse to exposure to spaceflight (p,0.01) (Fig. 6G). The\nexpression of Mdm2, a negative regulator of p53, was also\nincreased, indicating suppression of the p53 apoptotic pathway\n(Fig. 6G, Table 3). Several genes associated with cell cycle\nregulation were also altered in flight samples including cell cycle\narrest related genes Fbxo4, Fbxo31, Btg2, and Cdkn2b (1.87, 1.74,\n21.50, and 1.41 fold respectively, p,0.05), and cell cycle related\ngenes cyclin B2, Cdc25c, Mul1, Gdf10, and Csf3 (1.63, 1.55, 1.64,\n21.43 and 3.72 fold respectively, p,0.05) (Fig. 6G, Table 3).\nSeveral genes related to the induction of apoptosis were also\naltered including, Cradd, Dapk1, Fbxo3, which were up-regulated\nin flight samples (1.62, 1.53, and 1.48 fold respectively, p,0.01)\n(Fig. 6G). Hecw2, which acts to stabilize p73, was also up-\nregulated in flight samples (2.25, p,0.01), as was p73, albeit not\nstatistically significantly (2.02 fold, p = 0.20) (Table 3).\nIn order to determine the specific cellular localization of the p21\nand p53 proteins, we conducted immunohistochemical analysis on\nsections of the right proximal femur of both flight animals and\nsynchronous ground controls. Using a rabbit anti-mouse p21\npolyclonal antibody, we found that osteoblasts along the periosteal\nsurface of the proximal femur were p21-positive in flight samples\nTable 1.

Muscle\nfibers surrounding the femur contained strongly positive p21\nstaining nuclei in spaceflight but not ground control samples\n(Fig. 6C\u2013F). When we investigated the expression of p53 in\nproximal sections of the femur using a p53 polyclonal antibody, no\nsignificant staining was found in most sections from both flight and\nground controls\u2019, indicating that p53 was not strongly expressed.\nSpaceflight Alters Gene Expression That Can Interfere\nwith Survival and Mitogenic Signal Transduction\nAs cell signaling promoting cell survival via phosphoinositide 3-\nkinase (Pi3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) and cell proliferation via\nMitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAP kinase) can both be\nactivated in response to mechano-transduction, and as they can\nmodulate p53 and p21 signaling, we investigated key genes of\ninterest in these pathways with qPCR. MAP kinases, such as\nMAPK10, MAPK11, and MAPK12 (3.81, 21.54, and 21.43 fold\nrespectively, p,0.01), MAP 3 kinases, such as Moloney sarcoma\noncogene, Mos (24.18 fold, p,0.01), and cell growth molecules\nincluding Egr1 (22.30 fold, p,0.01) showed altered expression in\nspaceflight (Fig. 5, Table 3). Several molecules associated with Ras\nsignaling displayed alterations, including Nf1 (21.45 fold, p,0.05)\nand Sos1 (22.51 fold, p,0.01); however, only small changes in\nKRas expression was found (21.24 fold, p,0.05) (Fig. 5B,\nTable 3). No statistically significant alterations in Pi3K subunits\nwere noted except a small change in the alpha polypeptide of the\ncatalytic subunit of Pi3K (21.39 fold, p,0.01) (Table 3).\nAdditionally, no statistically significant alterations in Akt1 or 2\nFigure 2.

After exposure to\nmicrogravity, the NF-kB inhibitor, IkBa, exhibited a significant\nincrease in expression (2.03 fold, p,0.01) and NF-kB mRNA\nexhibited a slight decrease in expression (21.27 fold, p,0.05)\n(Fig. 5B, Table 3). Several downstream effectors of these signaling\npathways were also altered in response to spaceflight, including\nRps6kb1, a down-stream effector of the Pi3K/Akt/mTOR\npathway, and Eif4ebp1, a repressor of translation (22.05 and\n1.55 fold respectively, p,0.05). Eif4e, which is activated by\nRps6kb1 and inactivated by Eif4bp1, was also down-regulated\nslightly by spaceflight (21.40, p,0.05) (Fig. 5B, Table 3).\nTranscription factors and transcriptional targets associated with\nthese pathways were also investigated and it was found that\nactivated transcription factors c-Fos and Nfatc4 (22.37 and 21.98\nfold respectively, p,0.05) were altered in response to spaceflight.\nAnalysis of NFkB transcriptional target genes involved in cell\nadhesion, regulation of apoptosis and growth factors and ligands\nincluding Traf1, BMP4, Egr1, p53, and MMP3 (repressor) were\nfound to be down-regulated, indicating inhibition of this pathway\nafter exposure to spaceflight (Fig. 5B, Table 3).\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we investigated cellular and molecular gene\nexpression mechanisms underlying bone degeneration in space,\nwith an emphasis on the processes related to osteoblastic and\nosteocytic activities in the pelvic girdle and proximal femur of 16-\nweek-old C57BL/6J female mice. Although data in this field is not\nextensive, exposure to microgravity is known to alter bone\nhomeostasis, causing primarily increased osteoclast-mediated bone\nresorption, and possibly inhibition of bone formation. Here we\nsought to test the hypothesis that like osteoclastic activity,\nosteogenic cell cycle arrest and increased osteocytic osteolysis,\nmay also contribute to bone loss in space.\nWe first characterized standard bone mineral and structural\nparameters following spaceflight to establish the magnitude of\nbone loss in our microgravity model system. Our results confirm\nthe ischium portion of the pelvis (Fig. 1A) lost 6.3% (p = 0.005)\nbone volume fraction and 11.9% (p = 0.002) in bone thickness\n(Table 1) with an accompanying reduction in trabecular bridges\nbetween ischial surfaces (Fig. 1E\u2013G). In addition, bone loss was\naccompanied by large increases in osteoclast numbers (197%) and\nosteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces measured in the\nfemoral head (154%) (Fig. 3A\u2013D). This observed initial (15-day)\nrate of bone loss, translated to approximately 12%\u201324% loss per\nmonth, is high compared to established long-term astronaut bone\nloss values of 1\u20132% per month. The high-levels of osteoclastic\nactivity we observed may, however, subside after the initial\ntransition to microgravity. On earth at 1 g, patients with\ntetraplegia show an initial phase of pronounced cancellous bone\nloss, up to 30%, that subsides one-year post onset of paralysis [37].\nBed rest also results in increased osteoclast activity within 24 h of\nimmobilization [38], and 120 d bed rest causes increased bone\nresorption surfaces in the pelvis by osteoclasts [39]. After this initial\nphase of osteoclastic resorption in patients, cortical bone loss\ncontinues, although at a reduced rate that is medically more\nmanageable. If osteoclastic activity returns to normal after a period\nof transition after unloading, continued bone loss may correspond\nto reduced osteogenic activity and osteocytic osteolysis. Finally, the\ngeometry of the ischium in flight samples is also altered with a\nwider marrow cavity conformation than ground controls (Fig. 1B\u2013\nD, Table 2). Specifically, bone geometry near the ischial\ntuberosity, which provides a hindlimb muscle attachment surface,\nappears most altered. Among the muscles attaching to the ischium,\nthe quadratus femoris plays an important \u2018\u2018antigravity\u2019\u2019 role in\nFigure 3. TRAP Staining of Osteoclast and Osteocyte-Mediated Bone Resorption Following Spaceflight. Panel A displays a\nrepresentative cancellous region near the femoral head growth plate (406) from ground control mice, which is mostly free of TRAP-positive\nosteoclasts, whilst B displays a similar region from flight animals with numerous TRAP-positive osteoclasts. Analysis of osteoclastic activity in the\ntrabecular region below the femoral head of the femur showed an increase in osteoclast numbers in the bone surface of the growth plate of flight\nsamples compared to ground controls (9.99 Oc/mm and 3.36 Oc/mm respectively) (C). The bone surface covered by osteoclasts was also increased in\nflight animals compared to ground controls (25.40% and 9.99% respectively, D). The number of TRAP-positive osteocytes in cortical bone from the\nfemoral shaft proximal to the femoral head was increased in response to spaceflight (E) compared to ground controls (D) (34.43% and 20.94%\nrespectively, F). However, we found no differences in the number of empty lacunae in cortical bone between flight and ground controls (10.6% and\n10.0% empty lacunae respectively, H). * indicates p,0.05, # indicates p,0.01.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0061372.g003\nBone Loss and p21 Expression in Microgravity\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org\n6\nApril 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61372\nTable 3. mRNA Gene Expression Levels Altered Following Spaceflight.\nGene Symbol\nGene Name\nP-value\nLog2 Fold Change\nAkt1\nThymoma viral proto-oncogene 1\n0.32367\n21.164\nAkt2\nThymoma viral proto-oncogene 2\n0.65125\n1.048\nAkt3\nThymoma viral proto-oncogene 3 (PKB)\n0.00432\n21.324\nAnapc2\nAnaphase promoting complex subunit 2\n0.00037\n1.419\nBmp4\nBone morphogenetic protein 4\n0.01240\n21.990\nBtg2\nB-cell translocation gene 2, anti-proliferative\n0.00076\n21.498\nCcnb2\nCyclin B2\n0.02484\n1.629\nCdc25c\nCell division cycle 25 homolog C (S. pombe)\n0.00008\n1.551\nCdh11\nCadherin 11\n0.02569\n1.533\nCdh4\nCadherin 4\n0.00279\n2.463\nCdk2\nCyclin-dependent kinase 2\n0.87024\n21.052\nCdk4\nCyclin-dependent kinase 4\n0.90747\n1.038\nCdkn1a\nCyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21)\n0.000003\n3.307\nCdkn1b\nCyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B\n0.39548\n21.121\nCdkn2b\nCyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (p15)\n0.04005\n1.409\nCol11a1\nCollagen, type XI, alpha 1\n0.01885\n1.752\nCol14a1\nCollagen, type XIV, alpha 1\n0.01371\n1.407\nCol1a2\nCollagen, type I, alpha 2\n0.02999\n1.642\nCol2a1\nCollagen, type II, alpha 1\n0.02863\n1.599\nCradd\nCASP2 and RIPK1 domain containing adaptor with death domain\n0.00215\n1.619\nCsf3\nColony stimulating factor 3 (granulocyte)\n0.02020\n3.717\nCtgf\nConnective tissue growth factor\n0.02194\n1.412\nCul3\nCullin 3\n0.00346\n1.412\nDapk1\nDeath associated protein kinase 1\n0.00696\n1.525\nEgr1\nEarly growth response 1\n0.00938\n22.296\nEif4e\nEukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E\n0.03265\n21.404\nEif4ebp1\nEukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1\n0.01475\n1.547\nFbxo3\nF-box protein 3\n0.00017\n1.483\nFbxo31\nF-box protein 31\n0.00004\n1.739\nFbxo4\nF-box protein 4\n0.00040\n1.870\nFgf1\nFibroblast growth factor 1\n0.00262\n1.528\nFgf2\nFibroblast growth factor 2\n0.37555\n21.098\nFgf3\nFibroblast growth factor 3\n0.00074\n21.699\nFgfr1\nFibroblast growth factor receptor 1\n0.01634\n1.574\nFgfr2\nFibroblast growth factor receptor 2\n0.01981\n1.502\nFn1\nFibronectin 1\n0.73376\n1.037\nFos\nFBJ osteosarcoma oncogene\n0.04676\n22.366\nGdf10\nGrowth differentiation factor 10\n0.00736\n21.425\nHecw2\nHECT, C2 and WW domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2\n0.00098\n2.246\nIcam1\nIntercellular adhesion molecule 1\n0.00001\n21.523\nItgal\nIntegrin alpha L\n0.00263\n21.445\nKras\nV-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog\n0.04753\n21.243\nLama1\nLaminin, alpha 1\n0.01601\n21.774\nLama3\nLaminin, alpha 3\n0.04620\n1.582\nLamb3\nLaminin, beta 3\n0.01095\n1.947\nMapk10\nMitogen-activated protein kinase 10\n0.00003\n3.807\nMapk11\nMitogen-activated protein kinase 11\n0.02050\n21.541\nMapk12\nMitogen-activated protein kinase 12\n0.00129\n21.431\nMdm2\nTransformed mouse 3T3 cell double minute 2\n0.00241\n1.410\nBone Loss and p21 Expression in Microgravity\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org\n7\nApril 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61372\nmaintaining a neutral hind-limb posture and can atrophy in\nmicrogravity [40], possibly explaining the high levels of bone loss\nwe observed in the pelvis.\nHaving established that microgravity induces high-levels of\nosteoclast-mediated bone resorption in our model system, we then\nsought to determine if osteocytic osteolysis was also activated.\nOsteocytes, are the most abundant cell type in bone and are\nthought to play a role in spaceflight-induced bone loss [41,42,43].\nLacunar enlargement was previously reported in a 22-day\nspaceflight in the 1970s with juvenile rats but was not conclusively\ndemonstrated [34]. However, mice subjected to hindlimb unload-\ning do not show increased lacunar area, suggesting that osteocytic\nosteolysis does not play a role in bone loss due to hindlimb\nunloading at 1 g [36]. Using nanoCT (Fig. 2), we found no bone\ndensity differences in non-lacunar regions between flight and\nground samples. However, flight samples did exhibit lacunar\nenlargement relative to ground controls, as well as decreased\ncircularity, and increased canalicular diameter (Fig. 2C\u2013G). These\nresults suggest an increase in osteocytic degradation of lacunar\nsurfaces and highlight a possible difference in the ground-based\nmodel for mechanical hindlimb unloading at 1 g versus unloading\nin microgravity. Furthermore, the number of TRAP-positive\nosteocytes in flight samples was increased compared to ground\ncontrols, with no apparent differences in cell death or lacunar\nemptying (Fig. 3E\u2013H). Although TRAP is an iron containing\nenzyme known to be a specific and highly sensitive marker of bone\nresorption by osteoclasts, Nakano et al (2004) also showed TRAP\nactivity\nin\nosteocytes\n[44].\nTRAP-active\nosteocytes\nin\nthe\ntrabecular and cortical bone may therefore contribute to bone\nresorption in lacunae [44]. Furthermore, Qing et al (2012) found\nthat gene expression analysis of osteocyte-enriched bone from\nlactating mice exhibited increased expression of TRAP, as well as\nseveral other osteoclast specific genes such as cathepsin K,\ncarbonic anhydrase 1 and 2, and MMP13 [36]. TRAP may also\nbe needed for normal bone mineral remodeling and endochondral\nossification, as mice lacking TRAP exhibit an osteopetrotic\nTable 3.

It is currently debated whether osteocytes\ncontribute to bone remodeling and loss during spaceflight (for full\nreview see [33]), however, our results support a role for\nmicrogravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis.\nTo further investigate osteocyte-mediated molecular mecha-\nnisms associated with bone loss in space, we analyzed gene\nexpression changes relevant to bone extracellular matrix in\nmarrow-free bone tissue containing predominantly osteocytes but\nalso osteoblasts. We found increases in mRNA levels for several\ncollagen molecules and laminin subunits, suggesting increased\nmatrix remodeling, and significant up-regulation of mRNA for\nmatrix metalloproteinases 1, 3, and 10 in flight samples compared\nto ground controls, while MMP inhibitors showed no statistically\nsignificant alterations in expression (Fig. 4, Table 3). Remarkably\nwe also found that osteocytes embedded within the cortical bone of\nthe proximal femur were strongly MMP10 positive in flight\nsamples but not in ground controls, indicating that the up-\nregulation of MMP10 transcripts in flight samples may originate in\nosteocytes. ECM proteinases play a critical role in normal\npericellular matrix remodeling following environmental stimuli,\nsuch as mechanical load, and matrix calcium regulation in normal\nphysiological states as well as in many disease states, such as\nrheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis [46,47,48]. Previous studies\nhave shown that osteoclasts secrete MMP1 and 3 during bone\nremodeling [49]. Furthermore, stromelysins (MMP3 and 10)\nretain significant activity in the acidic environment found in\nosteoclast resorptive pits and are secreted by osteoclasts in the sub-\nosteoclastic resorptive zone [49]. The number of dendritic\nprocesses from an osteocyte also increases with age, indicating\nthat osteocytes embedded within the mineralized matrix may have\nthe ability to generate new processes [50,51]. In total, this gene\nand protein expression data, together with the ability of osteocytes\nto express the osteoclast marker TRAP and MMP10, support a\nrole for osteocytic osteolysis in microgravity.\nIn addition to a role for osteocytic osteolysis, we also\nhypothesized that bone loss in space may be mediated by\nintracellular signaling cascades that result in activation of p53\nand p21 during osteogenesis. Tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53) is\na growth suppressor and a transcriptional regulator which\nmodulates the expression of a wide range of genes involved in\ncell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation [52] and p53\nactivation generally results in apoptosis. Mice null for p53 exhibit\nextensive blood tumors and an osteopetrotic bone phenotype,\nindicating a role for the p53 signaling pathway in the regulation of\nbone formation and degradation [29,30]. Previous studies have\nalso demonstrated that p53 levels are increased in the muscle of\nanimals exposed to spaceflight [27] and that p53 knockout mice\nhave preserved trabecular bone volume following hindlimb\nunloading [28]. In contrast to these findings we determined that\nFigure 4. Spaceflight Causes Up-Regulation of Matrix Degra-\ndation Molecules.

Furthermore,\nexamination of osteocyte nuclei in lacunae from cortical bone of\nthe femur also revealed no differences in the number of empty\nlacunae, or nuclei with pyknotic morphology in spaceflight versus\nground control animals. Previous research, however, has found\nthat hindlimb unloading can result in osteocyte apoptosis and bone\nloss in the lumbar region of the spine [41]. Research into\nspaceflight versus 1 g simulations of spaceflight has, however,\nfound differences in bone loss mechanisms including in trabecular\nbone loss, cancellous mineralization, and bone resorption rates\n[53]. Our data, including decreased message levels of p53, lack of\nprotein accumulation of p53, and no alterations in osteocytic cell\ndeath, suggests that in contrast to hindlimb unloading, osteocyte\napoptosis is mostly absent in short-term spaceflight.\nPrevious studies have shown that periosteal bone formation is\ninhibited [25] and osteoblast populations are decreased [24] in\nresponse to spaceflight, however, the molecular mechanisms\ncausing this arrest of bone formation are not yet known. In\ncontrast to p53, which we found to be down-regulated, expression\nof CDKN1a/p21, a cell cycle arrest mediator immediately\ndownstream of p53, and other stress response pathways were\nup-regulated during spaceflight (Fig. 6, Table 3), which may cause\nan inhibition of osteogenesis and bone formation. Immunohisto-\nchemical analysis showed that p21 in flight samples was strongly\nlocalized to osteoblast nuclei on the periosteal surface of the femur\nand near the femoral head. In addition, spaceflight animals\nshowed increased nuclear p21 staining in muscle fibers attached to\nthe femur. MRL mice, which regenerate cartilage, skin, hair\nfollicles, and myocardium with high fidelity and without scarring\n[54], also lack p21 expression, providing evidence that p21 could\nplay a role in inhibiting\ntissue regeneration. In addition,\nCDKN1a/p21 knockout mice also have a regenerative phenotype\nsimilar to MRL mice, with normal development, early entry into S\nphase of the cell cycle, enhanced proliferation, and sensitivity to\nUV-induced apoptosis [31]. Elevated CDKN1a/p21 levels in\nspaceflight may therefore explain the observed reduction in\nosteogenesis and bone growth. The expression of CDKN1a/p21\nmay also occur in tissues, possibly resulting in a systemic cell cycle\nand tissue regenerative response. In addition to bone, our gene\nexpression results also show accumulation of p21 in muscle (Fig. 6)\nand heart tissue (A. Kumar, E.A.C. Almeida, and R.K. Globus,\nunpublished\nresults). One possible mechanism for systemic\nexpression of CDKN1a/p21 in the mouse may be oxidative stress\ninduced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Elevated levels of ROS\ncan result in increased lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of\nantioxidants, which have been reported both in spaceflight and\nhindlimb-unloading studies [55,56,57,58]. Although the effect of\nCDKN1a/p21 accumulation in muscle and cardiomyocytes is not\naddressed in this study, it is possible that a systemic activation of\nCDKN1a/p21 by ROS could be occurring and might interfere\nwith generalized tissue proliferation, repair and regeneration.\nVarious other genes associated with cell cycle regulation were\naltered in response to spaceflight, including cell cycle arrest\nmolecules and cell cycle regulation molecules (Table 3). Such\nmolecules included up-regulation of Fbxo4 and Fbxo31 that have\nbeen shown to stimulate the ubiquitination of Ccnd1 [59,60,61].\nCcnd1 promotes the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle\nand is also considered a mediator of signaling from extracellular\nstimuli to the cell cycle machinery. Furthermore, several of the up-\nregulated molecules, specifically, Ube2e3 and Mul1, are thought\nto be involved in cell growth arrest due to mitochondrial\nfragmentation. Although we have found no cellular evidence of\nincreased apoptosis, several apoptosis-related genes were also up-\nregulated in flight samples including Cradd, Dapk1, Fbxo31,\nHecw2 and MAPK10 (Table 3). The expression of these genes\nwithout increased cellular indications of apoptosis could be related\nto the survival-promoting function of p21 when the cell cycle is\narrested.\nIn order to determine the influence of spaceflight on osteogenic\nsignaling pathways, we conducted RT-qPCR analysis of growth\nfactor transcripts for genes involved in osteogenesis, bone\nmineralization, and their regulatory transcription factors. Altered\ngrowth factor binding in particular, can have significant impacts\non intracellular signaling cascades and gene expression. We found\nmessage expression reductions in TGF-b2; FGF1 and 3; BMP4;\nEgr1; and Csf3 (Fig. 5, Table 3). Tgf-b is produced by osteoblasts\nand deposited in bone matrix during bone formation, and released\nby osteoclasts during bone resorption [62]. Additionally, Tgf-b\ninduces proliferation and differentiation in osteoblasts while\ninhibiting osteoclast precursor differentiation and bone resorption\n[63,64]. Decreased levels of Tgf-b in the hindlimb of flight samples\ncompared to ground controls has previously been reported. Tgf-b\nhas also been suggested to play a critical role in the mechanosen-\nsing ability of bone and bone cells by serving as an intracellular\nmessenger between strain responsive cells and other bone cells\n[65]. Decreased levels of Tgf-b in the periosteum but not in the\ncancellous compartment of the hindlimb, correlated with decreas-\nes in periosteal bone formation and mineral deposition rates, are\nsuggestive of a role for Tgf-b in mechanical-loading-induced bone\nformation.\nWe also found decreases in the expression levels of Bmp4\nmessage (Table 3), which is one of the most potent inducers of\nbone formation through stimulation of osteoblast differentiation. It\nhas recently been shown that Bmp4-induced cell cycle arrest\nduring osteoblast differentiation is dependent on the induction of\np21 and p27 expression [66]. Several additional genes associated\nwith cell growth and differentiation including Myod1, Twist1, and\nEgr1 were also altered in spaceflight (Fig. 5A, Table 3). Myod1 is\nknown for its function in muscle cells where it causes increased\ndifferentiation through activation of p21 [67]. Myod1, however, is\nalso broadly expressed in other tissues and down-regulation of\nMyod1 message is suggestive of decreased p21-mediated cell\ndifferentiation. In agreement with this, Twist 1, known to be\ninvolved in differentiation by inhibiting DNA binding by Myod1\nand transactivation by Mef2, was up-regulated. Decreased Myod1\nexpression suggests a decrease in CDKN1a/p21 levels associated\nwith cell differentiation, and leads us to hypothesize that the\nCDKN1a/p21 elevation we observe in spaceflight is independent\nof differentiation, and possibly induced by the oxidative stress\nrelated to reduced mechanical load in microgravity. Egr1 has been\nshown to be regulated by c-Fos [68], however, Egr1 activation has\nalso been shown to occur independently of c-Fos through\nactivation of the Erk 1/2 pathway in response to shear stress.\nAlthough the exact mechanism regulating Egr1 activity is not\nexamined here, down-regulation of this molecule has important\nimplications for cell growth and differentiation due to its potential\nrole in the regulation of over 30 genes. Furthermore, decreased\nlevels of Egr1 leads to decreased formation of the Egr1/Sp1\ncomplex resulting in increased levels of free Sp1 available for\nbinding to the m-CSF promoter, increased m-CSF expression, and\nconsequently, more osteoclast formation [69]. The observed\ndecreases in TGF-b message could also contribute to decreased\nEgr-1 expression.\nVitamin D receptor and Sox9, two transcription factors\ninvolved in osteogenesis, were also differentially expressed in\nspaceflight. Vdr gene expression is stimulated by Ras/Raf/MAP\nBone Loss and p21 Expression in Microgravity\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org\n11\nApril 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61372\nkinase signaling through the AP-1 site on the Vdr promoter\n[46,70]. Vitamin D has been shown to modulate NFkB activity in\nmultiple cell types, which suggests a role for the Vitamin D\nreceptor in regulation of the NFkB pathway. Vdr-null mice have\nbeen shown to have decreased IkBa levels due to loss of vdr-p65\ninteraction affecting NFkB transcriptional activity [48]. This could\nprovide an additional mechanism for the observed inhibition of\nNFkB activation in our spaceflight samples. The MAP kinase-\nERK pathway is also known to activate the transcription factor\nSox9 [71], which is a regulatory factor required for chondrocyte\ndifferentiation [72]. Activation of Sox9 by p38-MAP kinase\nsignaling results in chondrocyte growth and differentiation while\ndepression of Sox9 transcription results in cartilage degeneration\nand osteo-arthritis [55,73]. Additionally, Sox9 is important for\nextracellular matrix production [73]. P38-MAP kinase down-\nregulation and loss of Sox9 transcriptional activation may\ntherefore have important implications for cartilage health and\nregeneration, and matrix production in spaceflight. Rps6kb1, a\ndown-stream effector of the Pi3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, was also\ndown-regulated in spaceflight (Table 3), and is involved in cell\nproliferation through the activation of protein synthesis by Eif4e\nand inhibition of apoptosis through phosphorylation of BAD (for\nfull review see [56]).\nConclusions\nIn total, our findings demonstrate the pelvic-femoral musculo-\nskeletal complex as a highly load and gravity sensitive structure\nthat can serve as a valuable model to study muscle and bone\ndegeneration in space. Additionally, we demonstrate that bone\nresponses to spaceflight are complex and involve osteoclastic,\nosteoblastic, and osteocytic degenerative responses. Finally, our\nfindings on CDKN1a/p21 up-regulation in microgravity have the\npotential to become a major concern for tissue regenerative health\nin long-duration spaceflight. Future studies should address the\nspecific molecular regulatory mechanisms of CDKN1a/p21\ninvolvement in tissue degeneration during long-term spaceflight\nand the possibility of systemic activation of this strong molecular\ninhibitor of regenerative adult stem cell proliferation.\nMethods\nEthics Statement\nAll experimental animal procedures for STS-131 were ap-\nproved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at\nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames\nResearch Center under protocol NAS-10-002-Y1, and conformed\nto the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and\nUse of Laboratory Animals.\nAnimals\nFemale, 16-week-old C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) were subjected to\n15-days of spaceflight on board the space shuttle Discovery during\nthe STS-131 mission, and as part of the NASA Biospecimen\nSharing Program for the spaceflight experiment \u2018\u2018Mouse Antigen-\nSpecific CD4+ T Cell Priming and Memory Response during\nSpaceflight\u2019\u2019. Animals used in this study were not subjected to\nexperimental procedures during spaceflight. Animals were housed\nin the NASA Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) habitats for the\nduration of the flight and were exposed to normal day/night\ncycles. The NASA AEM units are composed of a stainless steel\ngrid cage, fan blowers, a layered filter system, interior lamps, food\nbars and a water box. They are self-contained habitats that\nprovide up to 8 mice with constant access to food and water while\nalso providing a waste management system that isolates the\nanimals from their waste and food crumbs. The AEMs were\nhoused within a standard middeck locker on board the space\nshuttle. Animals were not acclimated to habitats prior to flight, but\nwere provided with both the food bars and water bottles used in\nflight for at least 2 weeks prior to launch. Synchronous ground\ncontrols were also conducted using identical AEM modules.\nSpaceflight\nand\nsynchronous\nground\ncontrol\nanimals\nwere\nweighed pre- and post-flight and were subjected to veterinary\nexamination before euthanasia. Food and water consumption of\neach group was measured upon recovery and averaged per mouse\nper day. Animals were euthanized approximately 2 h after landing\nusing isoflurane anesthesia followed by thoracotomy. Upon\nrecovery, the pelvis and femur were dissected and the soft tissue\nwas removed from the bones. The bone marrow was flushed from\nboth left and right ilium and proximal femora and used for other\nexperimental procedures not described in this paper. Care was\ntaken to avoid disturbing the cancellous bone and bone marrow in\nboth femoral heads during aspiration, to allow for TRAP and\nimmunohistochemical analysis of this region. Both ilia were placed\nin 1 ml RNAlater at 4uC for 24 h to enable it to penetrate the\nbone. Vials were then transferred to 280uC and shipped on dry\nice to NASA Ames Research Center for isolation of RNA and\ngene expression analysis. The pelvic ischium and proximal femur\nwere fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4uC, washed twice\nwith PBS, and stored in PBS at 4uC. The pelvic ischium was used\nfor microcomputed tomography (mCT) and nano-computed\ntomography (nCT), while the proximal femur was used for TRAP\nstaining and immunohistochemical analysis of proteins of interest\nas described below.\nMicro-Computed Tomography (mCT)\nMicro-computed tomography (mCT) was used to image and\nquantify bone morphometry of the ischium region in the right\ncoxa (SkyScan 1174 microCT scanner, Kontich, Belgium). Of the\noriginal 8 samples in each group, both flight and ground control\nhad one sample that was fractured during the dissection rendering\nit unsuitable for the mCT analysis (n = 7).\nScanning.\nEach ischium with soft tissue still intact, previously\nfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stored in PBS, was mounted\nvertically into a low-x-ray density Styrofoam holder, wrapped with\nPress-n-Seal film to prevent drying, and scanned in air. Images\nwere acquired at 50 kV and 800 mA with 0.5 mm aluminum x-ray\ndetector filter, a pixel resolution of 6.77 mm, voxel volume of\n310.29 mm3, an exposure time of 3.5 s per frame with 3 averaging\nframes, a rotation step of 0.5u, and a rotational angle of 180u.\nReconstruction.\nRaw image data were reconstructed into a\nstack of 2D cross-sectional slices using NRecon volumetric\nreconstruction software (Skyscan v1.6.3.2). Reconstruction was\ncarried out with a beam hardening correction of 30%, a ring\nartefact correction of 4, and a dynamic contrast range of 0 to 0.10.\nAnalysis of bone structure and mineral density.\nFor\nanalysis, a selected region of 4.89 mm (720 slices), starting from 5\nslices proximal to caudal apex of the obturator foramen through\nischial tuberosity (Fig. 1A), was analyzed using CTan software\n(Skyscan v1.10.9.0). A global binarization threshold of 65/255 was\napplied to the reconstructed images. As the mouse ischium is a thin\nbone with similarly sized bridge-like trabeculae connecting two\nopposing cortical sheets, we were unable to analyse cortical and\ntrabecular bone regions separately. Instead we contoured along a\nperimeter of the cortical bone using a \u2018\u2018shrink-wrap\u2019\u2019 custom plug-\nin of CTan software and analyzed them together. The following\nindices for mineralized tissue were investigated: total volume of\nregion of interest (TV), bone volume of region of interest (BV),\nbone volume fraction (BV/TV), average thickness (Th), and mean\nBone Loss and p21 Expression in Microgravity\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org\n12\nApril 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61372\nlinear attenuation coefficient. In addition to calculated indices, 3D\nanalysis included the generation of color-coded image maps of\nischial structure thickness. These images were loaded into CTvox\n3D visualization program (Skyscan v1.0.or479) for a qualitative\ncomparison of bone thickness between flight and ground control\ngroups. To gain some insight on whether the shape of the ischium\nhad changed with the flight environment, we examined a single\ncross-sectional slice, cut at the dorsal-most point of the descending\nischial ramus, and measured the bend angle, the length, and the\nwidth at two points, half and one-third of the way from the\nproximal end (Fig. 1D), using CTan measurement tools. A two-\ntailed student\u2019s t-test (GraphPad PRISM) was carried out to\ncompare the means, with p-value ,0.05 considered to be\nstatistically significant.\nNano-Computed Tomography (NanoCT)\nFollowing spaceflight, we performed high-resolution measure-\nments of bone density and lacunar nanostructure using the hard\nX-ray Transmission Microscopy (TXM) facility at the Stanford\nSynchrotron Radiation Light Source (SSRL). Analysis was\nperformed on similarly oriented transverse sections of cortical\nbone from mouse ischia near the dorsal-most point of the\ndescending ischial ramus.\nSample preparation.\nIschia from seven ground control and\neight spaceflight mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and\nstored in PBS, prior to cutting 30 mm thick cortical bone sections\nusing single-use steel histology blades.\nScanning.\nX-ray\nattenuation\nimages\nwere\nacquired\nat\n5.4 keV energy with 40 nm resolution. Triplicate 0u angle images\nof each sample for osteocyte lacunar and canalicular analysis were\nobtained with an exposure of 4 s and a beam intensity of 2. Images\nat 90u, were exposed for 8 s with a beam intensity of 1, and used to\nmeasure section thickness.\nMeasurement of bone mineral density.\nFor calibration of\nmineral\ndensity\nto\nan\nX-ray\nattenuation\ncurve,\nwe\nused\nchlorapatite crystals standards and methods previously described\n[22]. Briefly, to account for beam intensity variations, for each\nsynchrotron experimental run we imaged known size and mineral\ndensity chlorapatite crystal standards and plotted log x-ray\nattenuation relative to thicknesses in the 1 to 100 m size\ncalibration\nrange.\nBone\ndensity\nwas\nthen\ncalculated\nfrom\nmeasured 0u bone attenuation values and 90u section thickness\nvalues, relative to the standard x-ray attenuation curve.\nLacunar morphometry.\nFor quantification of lacunar area,\ncircularity, and perimeter, we used Image J software to trace\nlacunae in 0u angle images and measured area, circularity, and\nperimeter in the outlined regions of interest. To measure changes\nin the dimensions of canaliculi following spaceflight, we selected a\n15 mm region of interest extending into the bone from the lacunar\nwall surface, and measured canalicular diameters. Unpaired t-test\nanalysis was carried out to compare the means, with p-value\n,0.05 considered to be statistically significant.\nTartrate Resistant Acid Phosphatase (TRAP) Staining\nThe right proximal femur was used for tartrate resistance acid\nphosphatase staining. Bone marrow was gently aspirated from the\nshaft region of the femur so as not to disturb cancellous bone and\nbone marrow in the femoral head. Flushed bone was then\ndemineralized using 20% EDTA for 21 days, with solution\nchanges every three days. Decalcified bones were dehydrated in a\ngraded ethanol series and embedded in paraffin in preparation for\nimmunohistochemical analysis. Longitudinal sections of 7 mm\nthickness were prepared and immediately before analysis, sections\nwere deparaffinized in 100% xylene, and rehydrated in 100%\nEtOH, 95% EtOH, 75% EtOH and DI H2O consecutively.\nTRAP staining was then conducted on these sections (n = 6\nsections per animal, n = 5 mice). The sections were stained for\ntartrate\nresistant\nacid\nphosphatase\n(TRAP)\nusing\nan\nAcid\nPhosphatase Leukocyte Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Catalog #387A-\n1KT) according to the manufacturer protocol. Images were\nacquired immediately after staining at magnifications of 206 and\n406using a SPOT RT slider cooled CCD camera attached to an\nOlympus BX51 microscope. All images were taken at the same\nbalance, gain, and brightness. To quantify osteoclast numbers and\nosteoclast contact with bone surfaces we imaged the central\ncancellous bone region in the proximal femur just below the\ngrowth plate. Criteria for inclusion of osteoclasts in cell counts\nincluded TRAP-positive staining, at least 4 nuclei, and a contact\nsurface with cancellous bone of at least 10 mm. Using Image J, we\nmeasured the total number of osteoclasts that met the inclusion\ncriteria, length of cancellous bone surface, and length osteoclast\ncontact surface with cancellous bone. The following indices for\nmineralized tissue were investigated: total number of osteoclasts\nper mm of bone surface (N.Oc./BS), and percentage of osteoclast-\ncovered surface (Oc.S./BS). To analyze osteocytes, Image J was\nused to perform a cell count of TRAP-positive osteocytes and total\nnumber of osteocytes in the cortical bone immediately distal to the\ngrowth plate of the femur. All statistical analyses were performed\nusing an unpaired t-test to determine the significant differences\nbetween ground control and spaceflight samples.\nRNA Isolation and RT-qPCR Analysis\nTotal RNA was isolated from both RNAlater-fixed pelvic ilia\n(flushed of bone marrow) from spaceflight and ground control\nanimals using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen). Briefly, ilia were\nhomogenized with a hand held homogenizer in 1 ml of TRIzol\nreagent (Invitrogen, Catalog #15596-026) for 30\u201360 s. Homog-\nenized samples were incubated in TRIzol for an additional 5 min,\n200 ml of chloroform was added and samples were incubated for a\nfurther 3 min. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at\n4uC. The aqueous phase containing RNA was placed into a new\ntube and RNA was precipitated with 600 ml of isopropanol for\n10 min. Samples were centrifuged again at 12,000 g for 10 min at\n4uC and the supernatant was discarded. RNA was washed with\n1 ml 75% EtOH, centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4uC, the\npellet was air dried and re-dissolved in 30 ml RNase-free water.\nSamples were then purified using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen,\nCatalog #74104) with genomic DNA elimination step according\nto the manufacturers protocol. RNA concentration was measured\nusing spectrophotometry (Nanodrop, ThermoFisher) and quality\nwas examined with agarose gel electrophoresis. Gene expression\nwas analyzed using Qiagen Pathway-Focused Mouse qPCR\nArrays. We examined genes involved in osteogenesis, extracellular\nmatrix, ubiquitination, and the p53, Pi3K, NFkB, and MAP\nKinase, signaling pathways in bone tissue. Each array consisted of\nprimer sets for 84 pathway-focused genes of interest, five reference\ngenes (Gusb, Hprt1, Hsp90ab1, Gapdh, and Actb), one genomic\nDNA contamination control, three positive PCR controls and\nthree positive reverse transcription controls on a 96 well plate.\nOne mg of total RNA per sample (n = 6) was reverse transcribed to\ncDNA using RT2 First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (SABios-\nciences, Catalog #330401) according to the manufacturer\u2019s\nprotocol. Briefly, genomic DNA elimination buffer was added to\nthe sample and incubated at 42uC for 5 min. Reverse transcription\ncocktail containing primers, external controls and RT enzyme mix\nwas then added to the samples and samples were incubated at\n42uC for 15 min and the reaction was stopped by incubation at\n95uC for 5 min. The cDNA was mixed with RT2 SYBR Green/\nBone Loss and p21 Expression in Microgravity\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org\n13\nApril 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61372\nRox qPCR master mix and equal volumes (25 ml) were added to\nPCR plates. Plates were sealed with optical thin-walled 8-cap strips\n(Qiagen, Catalog #1065667) and qPCR of sample arrays was\nperformed using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR\ninstrument. Real-time PCR conditions were as follows: one cycle\n95uC for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95uC for 15 s and 60uC for 1 min,\nfollowed by one cycle of 95uC for 15 s, 60uC for 1 min, 95uC for\n15 s and 60uC for 15 s. Gene expression levels from all arrays\nwere analyzed for alterations in expression levels as compared to\nground controls (n = 6, p,0.05) using a PCR Array Data Analysis\nTemplate (v3.2, SABiosciences). Data analysis was based on the\nDDCt method and gene expression levels were normalized to four\nreference genes (Gusb, Hprt1, Gapdh, and Actb).\nImmunohistochemical and Immunocytochemical\nAnalysis\nSections of the right-proximal femur prepared as described\nabove for TRAP Staining were also used for immunohistochem-\nical and immunocytochemical analysis. The following primary\npolyclonal antibodies were used in the immunohistocehmical\nanalysis: anti-p21 (1:50 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-\np53\n(1:50\ndilution,\nSanta-Cruz\nBiotechnology),\nanti-Matrix\nMetallopeptidase 10 (1:20 dilution, Novus Biologicals) and anti-\nMdm2 (1:25 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Peroxidase\nconjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary\nantibody (1:5000 dilution, Jackson Immunoresearch). Briefly,\nsections were immersed in sodium citrate buffer for 10 min at\n95uC, washed in DI water and immersed in PBS containing 0.1%\nTriton X-100, pH 7.4 (265 min). Sections were then blocked in\n10% normal blocking serum (Donkey serum in PBS-T) for a\nperiod of 1 h in a moist chamber at room temperature. Primary\nantibody incubation was conducted in a moist chamber at 4uC\novernight. Sections were washed in PBS-T and incubated with\nperoxidase conjugated secondary antibody in a moist chamber at\nroom temperature for 1 h and then rinsed with PBS-T and\nincubated in peroxidase substrate for 12\u201330 min until staining was\ncomplete. Sections were washed in DI water and dehydrated in\n75%, 95% and 100% EtOH followed by 100% xylene for 3 min at\neach stage. Sections were mounted in mounting medium and\nvisualized using an Olympus BX51 light microscope. For osteocyte\nnuclear localization, we used Hoechst 33342 staining (500 ng/ml\nin DI water for 10 min at room temperature, Invitrogen, Catalog\n#H1399) on deparaffinized sections of the right-proximal femur\nprepared as described above. Lacunae with and without Hoechst\nstained nuclei, and nuclear pyknotic morphology were used to\nquantify osteocyte apoptosis.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: EAB ND RKG EA.

This review\nexamines the effects of microgravity on biological processes and their implications for\nhuman health. Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system by disrupting key\nmechanisms, such as T cell activation, cytokine production, and macrophage differenti-\nation, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. In cancer biology, it promotes the\nformation of spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, which closely mimic\nin vivo tumor dynamics, providing novel insights for oncology research. Additionally,\nmicrogravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways, including\nHippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and\ncardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hep-\natic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid\ndysregulation, vascular remodeling, and accelerated bone loss. Notably, cardiomyocytes de-\nrived from human pluripotent stem cells and cultured under microgravity exhibit enhanced\nmitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium handling, and advanced structural matura-\ntion, including increased sarcomere length and nuclear eccentricity. These advancements\nenable the development of functional cardiomyocytes, presenting promising therapeutic\nopportunities for treating cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarctions. These findings\nunderscore the dual implications of microgravity for space medicine and terrestrial health.\nThey highlight its potential to drive advances in regenerative therapies, oncology, and\nimmunological interventions.

Introduction\nMicrogravity, a condition characterized by minimal and almost imperceptible gravita-\ntional forces, occurs primarily in space or in specialized environments designed to simulate\nthis state [1,2]. In cellular biology, microgravity presents a unique opportunity to study\nhow cells respond to the drastic reduction in gravity\u2014a fundamental factor that regulates\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26073058\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n2 of 23\nnumerous cellular processes on Earth [3\u20135]. Under microgravity conditions, mechanical\nforces that influence cell structure and function undergo significant alterations, impacting\ncytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and intracellular signaling. These changes in turn\naffect critical cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, communication,\nand survival [4\u20136].\nHistorically, research on microgravity has been conducted aboard space stations, such\nas the International Space Station, and on suborbital platforms. More recently, terrestrial\nlaboratories have adopted advanced technologies, such as rotating bioreactors, to simulate\nmicrogravity conditions [1,7,8]. These investigations, conducted both in space and on Earth,\nhave gained importance due to their dual applications: safeguarding astronaut health and\naddressing terrestrial diseases [1,9,10].\nThis review aims to explore recent advances in understanding the effects of microgravity\non biological processes, emphasizing its implications and applications for human health.\n2. Materials and Methods\nA comprehensive literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Em-\nbase databases. Search terms were structured following the PICOT framework, with the\ncomponents defined as follows:\n\u2022\nPopulation: Stem cells, T cells, endothelial cells, cancer cells, kidney cells, and bone cells.\n\u2022\nIntervention: Microgravity, simulated microgravity, or microgravity conditions.\n\u2022\nComparison: Cells under normal or standard gravity conditions.\n\u2022\nOutcomes: Effects on cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, cellular metabolism, organ\nhomeostasis, and immune health.\n\u2022\nTiming: Publications with no start date restriction, available up to November 2024.\nThe research question, based on the PICO framework, was as follows:\n\u201cHow does microgravity (including simulated conditions) affect stem cells, T cells, en-\ndothelial cells, kidney cells, and other biological cells compared to cells under normal\ngravity conditions, specifically in terms of cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, cellular\nmetabolism, organ homeostasis, and immune health?\u201d\nTo ensure a comprehensive search, relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms\nwere included. Key terms covered the study populations (e.g., stem cells, T cells, endothe-\nlial cells, cancer cells, kidney cells, bone cells), conditions (e.g., microgravity, simulated\nmicrogravity, standard gravity), and outcomes of interest (e.g., cell proliferation, tissue\nregeneration, cellular metabolism, organ homeostasis, immune health).\nThe literature search was performed in December 2024 and included publications in\nEnglish and Spanish. Eligible studies encompassed observational studies, in vitro research,\nand experimental investigations that addressed the effects of microgravity on critical\nbiological processes. The retrieved results were systematically categorized based on their\nfocus, enabling a detailed analysis of microgravity\u2019s impact on different biological functions.\nThe findings were then contrasted with observations from cells maintained under standard\ngravity conditions, providing a comprehensive comparison of cellular adaptations in\nthese environments.\n3. Effects of Microgravity on the Immune System\n3.1. Alterations in Immune Cells\nMicrogravity significantly impacts the immune system, compromising the develop-\nment, function, and response of immune cells, which weakens the body\u2019s defenses in\nspace environments. Hematopoietic stem cells, essential for generating immune cells,\nshow impaired differentiation into macrophages, critical for infection control. Furthermore,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n3 of 23\nan imbalance between M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory and repair)\nmacrophages disrupts the immune system\u2019s ability to handle infections and repair tis-\nsues [1,2].\nDendritic cells, pivotal in T lymphocyte activation via antigen presentation, are also\nadversely affected. Key molecules such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and\ncostimulatory proteins CD80 and CD86 show reduced expression, diminishing dendritic\ncell functionality. Notably, brief exposures to microgravity transiently enhance dendritic\ncell activity; however, this effect is not sustained over the long term [2].\nNeutrophils exhibit increased numbers in microgravity but with reduced functionality,\nimpairing their ability to destroy microorganisms effectively. B lymphocytes, responsible for\nhumoral immunity, demonstrate decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Similarly,\nnatural killer (NK) cells, critical for innate immunity, experience reduced cytotoxic activity,\nlimiting their ability to eliminate tumors or infected cells [2,3] (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Effects of microgravity on the human immune system. This figure illustrates the complex\nimpact of microgravity on various immune cell populations and key molecular signaling pathways.\nExposure to microgravity leads to significant alterations in immune cell function, including a shift in\nmacrophage polarization from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2\nphenotype. Dendritic cells exhibit a reduced capacity for antigen presentation, while neutrophil\nnumbers increase, but their functionality declines. Additionally, the cytotoxic activity of natural killer\n(NK) cells is diminished, potentially impairing immune surveillance. T cell activation, proliferation,\nand cytokine production are also suppressed, accompanied by decreased expression of IL-2R. At the\nmolecular level, microgravity disrupts critical signaling pathways, including the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK\ncascade and the NF-\u03baB pathway, further contributing to immune dysregulation. These findings\nhighlight the widespread and multifaceted effects of microgravity on immune system function, which\nmay have implications for long-term space travel and astronaut health.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n4 of 23\n3.2. Impact on T Cells\nMicrogravity profoundly affects T cell-mediated immunity, disrupting activation,\nproliferation, and apoptosis. Studies using concanavalin A\u2014a standard activator of resting\nT cells\u2014revealed significant inhibition of activation and proliferation in CD4+ and CD8+ T\ncells, with the effects intensifying over longer exposure durations. Reduced expression of\nactivation markers such as CD25 (IL-2 receptor), CD69 (early activation marker), and CD71\n(iron transport marker) underscores this dysfunction [11,12].\nCD4+ T cells, critical for regulating immune responses through cytokines like IL-2 and\nIFN-\u03b3, show a greater reduction in proliferation and cytokine production compared to CD8+\nT cells. Even brief exposure (8 h) to microgravity notably suppresses CD4+ cell functions,\nwhile CD8+ cells require longer exposure (16 h) to exhibit similar impairments [11,12].\nCytokine production is notably compromised under microgravity. CD4+ cells exhibit\ndecreased secretion of IL-2, essential for T cell expansion, and IFN-\u03b3, crucial for macrophage\nactivation and antiviral defense. These deficiencies indicate a reduced capacity of T cells to\ncoordinate and amplify immune responses [11].\nApoptosis of T cells is accelerated under microgravity, with an earlier onset of late\napoptotic processes. Pre-exposed cells show an increase in late-stage apoptosis and a reduc-\ntion in early-stage apoptosis, indicating a faster progression through apoptotic pathways\ncompared to controls under normal gravity. This effect is linked to increased expression\nof the Fas receptor in CD8+ cells, a critical component of the Fas/FasL pathway, which\nregulates apoptosis through external signals [12\u201314] (Figure 1).\n3.3. Impact on Key Molecular Pathways\nAt the molecular level, microgravity disrupts critical signaling pathways, including\nRAS, ERK, and NF-\u03baB. The RAS pathway, which governs cell proliferation and survival,\nshows reduced activity under microgravity, leading to impaired cell growth. Similarly,\nERK, which is essential for cell differentiation and responses to external stimuli, undergoes\nalterations that hinder the activation and specialization of macrophages and lymphocytes.\nNF-\u03baB, a key regulator of inflammatory responses, exhibits inconsistent activation in\nmicrogravity, resulting in inadequate immune responses [1,4].\nResearch on microgravity has also revealed significant effects on cancer biology, includ-\ning the formation of multicellular spheroids (MCS), the reorganization of the cytoskeleton,\nand the regulation of key proteins such as p53 (a tumor suppressor), NF-\u03baB (a regulator\nof immune responses and inflammation), and BAX (a pro-apoptotic protein involved in\nprogrammed cell death). These processes promote apoptosis in various cancer cell types.\nIn cell lines from breast (MCF-7), thyroid (FTC-133), and lung (A549) cancers, microgravity-\ninduced changes include decreased cell adhesion and altered gene expression, particularly\nin molecules like E-cadherin (important for cell adhesion and tumor invasion suppression),\nvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, which promotes angiogenesis), and vimentin\n(a protein associated with epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and cell migration), thereby\naffecting tumor proliferation and dissemination [15,16].\n4. Impact on Cancer Biology\n4.1. Cancer Stem Cells\nThe study of cancer stem cells (CSCs) under simulated microgravity conditions pro-\nvides critical insights into their behavior in extreme environments, with profound implica-\ntions for oncology and regenerative medicine. CSCs, characterized by their self-renewal\nand differentiation capabilities, contribute to tumor heterogeneity, treatment resistance,\nand metastasis [5,6].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n5 of 23\nIn cancers such as breast, lung, and gastrointestinal cancer, CSCs are identified using\nspecific markers, enabling their isolation and detailed analysis. Under simulated micrograv-\nity, these cells exhibit significant changes in morphology and growth patterns, including\nthe formation of multicellular spheroids. These three-dimensional structures closely mimic\nin vivo tumor organization, offering a robust model for studying the effects of microgravity\non tumor biology [5,7,8].\nExposure to microgravity induces notable cellular changes, including increased apop-\ntosis and decreased expression of pluripotency-related markers, suggesting a shift toward\ndifferentiation. This differentiation reduces CSC resistance, potentially enhancing their\nsusceptibility to treatments. In gastrointestinal cancers like colon and pancreatic cancer,\nsimulated microgravity has been linked to increased expression of specific markers, re-\nflecting alterations in the regulatory mechanisms of cell growth and differentiation. These\nchanges can significantly influence tumor progression and the efficacy of oncological\ntreatments [6\u20138] (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Microgravity-induced changes in cancer. This figure illustrates the diverse effects of\nmicrogravity on cancer cells, with a particular focus on cancer stem cells (CSCs) and thyroid cancer.\nExposure to microgravity has been shown to increase apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in cancer\ncells. It also alters CSC properties, leading to a decrease in pluripotency markers and an increase\nin differentiation. Additionally, microgravity induces structural changes in the cytoskeleton and\nextracellular matrix, which may influence tumor progression. In thyroid cancer, microgravity reduces\nproliferation and overall growth, while also diminishing the malignant phenotype in follicular\nthyroid cancer cells. Interestingly, despite these inhibitory effects, microgravity appears to increase\nthe susceptibility of cancer cells, potentially enhancing their response to treatments, as suggested by\nthe syringe graphic. These findings highlight the complex and sometimes counterintuitive influence\nof microgravity on cancer biology.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n6 of 23\nMicrogravity modulates apoptosis, a key defense against abnormal cell proliferation.\nMany cancer cells under microgravity show increased apoptosis due to altered mechanical\nforces, while some acquire stem-like properties, enhancing resistance, plasticity, and therapy\nresistance [17,18]. Microgravity also induces the formation of multicellular spheroids (MCS),\nwhich mimic solid tumors and exhibit increased resistance to chemotherapy and radiation,\nsuggesting more aggressive cancer states. Additionally, reduced gravity downregulates\nadhesion proteins (e.g., E-cadherin, vinculin, paxillin), weakening cell\u2013cell interactions and\npotentially enhancing metastatic potential. The combination of microgravity and ionizing\nradiation exacerbates DNA damage, genomic instability, and mutations in tumor cells,\nhighlighting the need for protective measures during space missions and offering insights\ninto cancer treatment [19\u201322].\nSimulated microgravity, using devices like the rotating wall bioreactor (RWV) and\nrandom positioning machine (RPM), replicates certain effects of real microgravity (r-\u00b5g) but\nwith some differences. High-energy radiation with high linear energy transfer (high LET)\nincreases genomic instability and mutation risks, promoting apoptosis and chromosomal\naberrations [23,24].\nIn gliomas (U251 model), microgravity reduces the activity of focal adhesion kinase\n(FAK), RhoA, and Nek2 kinase, inhibiting tumor cell migration. Immune cells, such as\nT lymphocytes and macrophages, show decreased functionality, compromising immuno-\nsurveillance and hindering cancer detection [25\u201327].\nRecent findings suggest that microgravity could offer therapeutic benefits by inhibiting\nNF-\u03baB, reducing cancer spread, and decreasing VEGF activity to limit tumor growth\nthrough reduced angiogenesis. Changes in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway may slow tumor\ngrowth and metastasis. CSCs, typically resistant to therapies, become more vulnerable\nunder microgravity, which also alters extracellular vesicle (EV) protein and microRNA\ncontent, opening opportunities for new biomarkers and targeted therapies [28].\nThe mechanosensitive channel ELKIN1 plays a crucial role in cellular responses to mi-\ncrogravity. Microgravity reduces tumor cell adhesion and invasion, offering potential thera-\npeutic benefits, but these effects are ELKIN1-dependent. Its absence preserves cell structure\nand adhesion stability in microgravity, protecting healthy cells during prolonged exposure,\nbut may enhance the persistence of cancer cells, limiting therapy effectiveness [29].\nAt the molecular level, microgravity reduces the nuclear localization of the transcrip-\ntional regulator YAP1, limiting excessive cell proliferation and invasiveness. This effect\ndepends on ELKIN1 expression; its absence could lead to resistance or diminished respon-\nsiveness to mechanical stimuli. ELKIN1-mediated reduction in focal adhesion proteins may\nlimit tumor aggressiveness but could pose a structural disadvantage for healthy tissues\nduring extended space missions [29].\n4.2. Thyroid Cancer\nMicrogravity, whether experienced in space or simulated on Earth, provides a unique\nexperimental environment that has greatly advanced our understanding of cancer biology,\nparticularly thyroid cancer [30\u201333]. For nearly two decades, studies on thyroid cancer cells\nunder microgravity have yielded valuable insights into tumor behavior that are difficult to\nachieve under conventional laboratory conditions.\nIn microgravity, adherent thyroid cancer cells lose their adhesion properties and\norganize into multicellular spheroids. These structures closely resemble the physiological\ncharacteristics of tumors in vivo, making them ideal models for studying metastasis and\nevaluating novel targeted therapies [30,31].\nMicrogravity also affects fundamental cellular processes, including apoptosis, cy-\ntoskeletal organization, and extracellular matrix dynamics, which are critical for cell growth\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n7 of 23\nand proliferation. Notably, follicular thyroid cancer cells exposed to microgravity have\ndemonstrated a tendency to adopt a less malignant phenotype. This suggests that micro-\ngravity conditions may induce favorable changes, potentially aiding in the treatment of\nthyroid cancer [30,31].\nThe findings from these studies have the potential to revolutionize traditional oncology\nresearch approaches. They facilitate the identification of key cellular alterations in cancer\npathogenesis and support the development of innovative therapies aimed at improving\npatient outcomes. Furthermore, these investigations pave the way for novel preventive\nstrategies and more effective treatments based on the unique cellular properties observed\nunder microgravity [30,32].\n5. Impacts on Tissues and Organ Systems\n5.1. Microvascular Endothelial Cells\nSimulated microgravity profoundly affects microvascular endothelial cells, which\nplay a pivotal role in vascular homeostasis by regulating inflammation, angiogenesis, and\nvascular permeability [9,10].\nUnder normal gravity, endothelial cells respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli to\npreserve vascular function. However, under simulated microgravity, significant alterations\nare observed. One prominent effect is the inhibition of cell proliferation, which delays the\nrepair of damaged blood vessels. Reduced production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine\ncrucial for the inflammatory response, further compromises immune functionality and\nvascular repair capacity [9,23].\nInterestingly, microgravity stimulates the synthesis of nitric oxide, a critical mediator\nfor blood vessel dilation and angiogenesis. This effect is linked to the activation of en-\ndothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). While nitric oxide promotes vascular adaptation, its\ndysregulation can lead to pathological states, depending on the physiological context [9,23].\nResearch on simulated microgravity has also revealed significant effects on endothelial\ncell integrity and function. In one study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, essential\nregulators of cardiovascular homeostasis, were exposed to simulated microgravity for up to\n72 h using an RPM, which continuously rotates to nullify Earth\u2019s gravitational vector [24].\nAfter 24 h, notable changes in cellular biomechanical properties were observed, in-\ncluding a marked reduction in cell stiffness (Young\u2019s modulus) and viscosity. Specifically,\ncellular elasticity decreased by approximately 30%, reaching critical levels with a 75% re-\nduction after 72 h. This loss of rigidity makes endothelial cells more vulnerable to external\nhemodynamic stress, potentially impairing vascular integrity and increasing the risk of\nendothelial dysfunction [23,24].\nAdditionally, endothelial cells exhibited morphological changes under simulated\nmicrogravity conditions. Normally elongated and spindle-shaped, cells adopted a distinctly\nrounded phenotype after 24 h. The increase in circularity\u2014more than three times greater\nthan that of control cells\u2014indicates significant cytoskeletal reorganization, which could\naffect vascular permeability and the cells\u2019 ability to respond to mechanical stress over\ntime [23,34].\nAt the molecular level, these morphological alterations were associated with sub-\nstantial reductions in key cytoskeletal components. Western blot analysis revealed a\n65% reduction in actin filament levels and a 26% reduction in \u03b2-tubulin, a protein crit-\nical for microtubule integrity. Immunofluorescence confirmed these findings, showing\ndiscontinuities in cortical actin filaments and abnormal redistribution of microtubules,\nparticularly around the nucleus. These results highlight impaired structural integrity and\nsuggest that endothelial cells may have a compromised ability to respond to biomechanical\nstimuli [23,34] (Figure 3).\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n8 of 23\nFigure 3. Structural and functional adaptations of tissues and organ systems in microgravity environ-\nments. This figure illustrates the broad impact of microgravity on various tissues and organ systems,\nhighlighting key structural and functional adaptations. Microvascular endothelial cells exhibit inhib-\nited proliferation, decreased IL-6 production, and increased nitric oxide (NO) production. In the liver,\nmicrogravity alters hepatic metabolism, leading to increased lipotoxicity, elevated angiopoietin levels,\nupregulation of lipid metabolism genes, and dysregulation of immune response genes. Intestinal\nhomeostasis is also affected, with observed dysbiosis, endotoxemia, altered bile acid content, and\nincreased levels of intestinal stress hormones. In terms of bone health and mechanotransduction,\nmicrogravity induces significant bone mass loss, accompanied by a reduction in actin filaments\nand decreased cell stiffness in osteoblasts. Kidney cells experience metabolic alterations, includ-\ning reduced oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, alongside increased expression\nof fibronectin (FN1), MMP7, and TGFBI. Reproductive cells are also impacted, with evidence of\nreduced egg quality, the loss of polarization in granulosa cells, and a decrease in microvilli in eggs.\nAdditionally, cardiomyocytes exhibit increased maturation and functionality, enhanced mitochondrial\nbiogenesis, improved calcium storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the formation of sarcomeres\nand Z-disks. These findings collectively underscore the widespread and system-specific alterations\ninduced by microgravity, significantly influencing cellular function and overall tissue homeostasis.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n9 of 23\nEndothelial cells exposed to microgravity also form three-dimensional spheroids,\nwhich closely mimic in vivo blood vessel structures. These 3D models are invaluable for\nstudying microgravity-induced changes in endothelial function, enabling more physiologi-\ncally relevant investigations compared to traditional 2D cultures [9,10,23].\nCollectively, these findings reveal that microgravity disrupts endothelial physiology,\ninfluencing cell proliferation, inflammatory responses, and vascular regulation. These\ninsights have implications for diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, and other circulatory\ndisorders. They underscore the need for further research to mitigate vascular risks during\nspace missions and explore potential therapeutic applications on Earth [9].\n5.2. Hepatic Metabolism and Intestinal Homeostasis\nMicrogravity, a defining feature of spaceflight and terrestrial simulations, profoundly\nimpacts the metabolism and functionality of various organs, particularly the liver. Experi-\nmental models using rhesus macaques have shown that prolonged exposure to microgravity\ninduces significant metabolic alterations similar to those observed in rodents. These in-\nclude lipid accumulation and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the liver, reflecting the\ndisruption of hepatic metabolic homeostasis. Such findings underscore the importance of\nexploring the effects of microgravity on metabolic regulation in animal models and future\nhuman studies [34\u201336] (Figure 3).\nIn a 42-day head-down bed rest model simulating microgravity, rhesus macaques\ndeveloped mild liver lesions, fat vacuole accumulation, and inflammatory cell infiltra-\ntion. These hepatic changes were accompanied by a marked increase in plasma levels of\nangiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3), a key biomarker associated with metabolic disorders and\nlipid dysregulation. These results suggest that microgravity may induce hepatic lipotoxicity,\na phenomenon previously documented in rodents but requiring further investigation in\nprimates and humans to better understand its clinical relevance [34\u201336].\nAt the molecular level, transcriptomic analyses of liver samples from macaques ex-\nposed to microgravity revealed overexpression of genes associated with lipid metabolism\nand downregulation of genes linked to the innate immune response. These molecular\nchanges could impair the liver\u2019s ability to manage metabolic stress, a critical function for\nmaintaining long-term health. Additionally, disruptions in fatty acid metabolism were iden-\ntified, potentially contributing to lipid dysregulation associated with metabolic diseases\nsuch as diabetes and obesity [34,35].\nAnother noteworthy finding was the impact of microgravity on the gut microbiota, a\nkey regulator of hepatic metabolism through the gut\u2013liver axis. Macaques subjected to the\nhead-down bed rest model exhibited intestinal dysbiosis, endotoxemia, and altered bile acid\ncomposition. These gut alterations were accompanied by elevated levels of stress hormones,\nsuggesting systemic metabolic imbalance triggered by microgravity exposure [34,36].\nThe effects of microgravity on liver function and metabolic homeostasis carry signifi-\ncant implications for space medicine. These findings highlight the need to closely monitor\nliver function and the gut\u2013liver axis during prolonged space missions to mitigate potential\nhealth risks. Moreover, the metabolic changes observed in animal models provide valuable\ninsights into terrestrial diseases such as diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This\nknowledge could contribute to the development of more effective treatments and innova-\ntive therapeutic strategies in regenerative medicine, ultimately benefiting both astronauts\nand the general population [34\u201336].\n5.3. Bone Health and Mechanotransduction\nMicrogravity profoundly impacts the mechanotransduction of human osteoblasts.\nAstronauts who spend prolonged periods in space experience accelerated bone mass loss,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n10 of 23\nmaking the International Space Station (ISS) an ideal platform for studying the mechanisms\nunderlying osteoporosis in zero-gravity conditions [37\u201339].\nIn this context, innovative experimental approaches have been developed, including\nthe use of microfluidic microchips and collagen-encapsulated cell spheroids. These ad-\nvanced models enable researchers to investigate how the absence of mechanical loading\naffects bone cell maturation and mineralization. Studies have shown that microgravity\ndecreases cell stiffness and reduces the levels of filamentous actin, a cytoskeletal component\ncritical for maintaining cell tension and facilitating mechanotransduction. For example,\nexperiments conducted on the ISS using automated microfluidic devices have provided\nvaluable insights into the mechanical properties of human osteoblasts under microgravity\nconditions [37\u201339] (Figure 3).\nResults from these experiments reveal that osteoblasts exposed to microgravity de-\nvelop elongated protrusions compared to terrestrial samples, indicating a phenomenon\nreferred to as \u201ccellular softening\u201d. This structural change correlates with a reduction in\nactin fiber density, consistent with findings from prior studies conducted under simulated\nmicrogravity [40\u201342].\nThese structural and cytoskeletal alterations highlight disruptions in mechanotrans-\nduction, the process through which cells sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. Without\nthe constant gravitational forces present on Earth, osteoblasts lose the ability to maintain\ntheir tensional structure and perform optimally, contributing to the bone demineralization\nobserved in astronauts [38,39].\nFurther research has utilized three-dimensional spheroid models, which better repli-\ncate physiological conditions than traditional two-dimensional cell cultures. Collagen-\nencapsulated osteoblast spheroids subjected to controlled pressures under microgravity\nexhibited a reduction in the expression of key mechanosensitive proteins, such as Yes-\nassociated protein (YAP). This suggests that microgravity disrupts mechanical signaling\npathways critical for cellular regulation and bone homeostasis [37\u201349].\nMechanotransduction is a crucial process by which cells sense and respond to me-\nchanical stimuli through interactions with the extracellular matrix. On Earth, proteins\nlike YAP/TAZ translate mechanical forces into gene expression changes, modulating cell\ngrowth, differentiation, and survival. Under microgravity, the diminished activity of\nYAP/TAZ leads to varying outcomes in different cancers, such as reduced cell prolifer-\nation or increased invasiveness due to altered mechanosignaling. Understanding these\ndifferential responses could inform novel therapeutic strategies targeting these vulnerabili-\nties [19\u201322].\nImportantly, the application of compressive pressure partially restored YAP expression\nand increased pSMAD1/5/9 levels, demonstrating that biomechanical signals can reacti-\nvate essential molecular pathways, even under microgravity conditions. These findings\nunderscore the potential of mechanical interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of\nmicrogravity on bone tissue [39\u201341,43].\nThe implications of these studies are significant. They not only advance our un-\nderstanding of how microgravity influences cellular biology but also pave the way for\ndeveloping therapeutic strategies to combat bone loss in both space environments and\nterrestrial patients with osteoporosis. Additionally, the creation of devices that simulate\nmechanical loads could benefit astronauts and individuals on Earth, emphasizing the criti-\ncal role of biomechanics in maintaining bone health and cellular functionality in extreme\nconditions [39\u201341,43].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n11 of 23\n5.4. Kidney Cells\nA recent study utilizing a microphysiological model of human renal proximal tubules\ninvestigated the effects of microgravity on the cellular ability to metabolize vitamin D and\nrespond to human serum [44,45].\nThe findings revealed that short-term exposure to microgravity does not significantly\nalter essential biochemical pathways in renal cells, indicating that fundamental processes\nremain intact. In this experiment, renal proximal tubule epithelial cells were cultured in a\nmicrophysiological system and exposed to 2% human serum and vitamin D [25(OH)D3].\nBiomarkers such as kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were mea-\nsured to assess cellular responses [44\u201346].\nTranscriptomic analyses, conducted via RNA sequencing, monitored vitamin D\nmetabolites and key genes involved in its metabolism, including CYP27B1, CYP24A1,\nand CYP3A5 [44]. Surprisingly, no significant differences in vitamin D metabolism were\nobserved between microgravity and terrestrial conditions. However, exposure to hu-\nman serum elicited similar metabolic responses in both environments, characterized by\nmetabolic reprogramming, alterations in bioenergetic processes, and the presence of a\npro-inflammatory extracellular environment [44\u201346].\nOne of the most striking observations was the differential regulation of over 2000\ngenes after exposure to human serum, regardless of gravitational conditions. Affected\npathways included the cell cycle, cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interactions, and chemokine\nsignaling [45]. Notably, a marked reduction in the expression of genes associated with\noxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism indicated diminished mitochondrial\nrespiration, suggesting a metabolic shift in kidney cells [45].\nThese findings imply that kidney cells, when exposed to human serum, redirect\ntheir metabolism toward a proliferation-focused strategy, reducing reliance on traditional\nenergy pathways. Concurrently, significant changes in the extracellular environment\nwere observed, indicative of tissue remodeling. This phenomenon was supported by the\noverexpression of genes related to the extracellular matrix, including fibronectin (FN1)\nand transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein (TGFBI), as well as enzymes such\nas metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7), which are involved in remodeling and reorganizing the\ncellular environment. These adaptations may represent a cellular response to protein\nchallenges in human serum or could signal underlying pathological processes [44].\nIn addition to bioenergetic and extracellular matrix alterations, broader metabolic\nreorganization signals were detected. Elevated cytosolic cholesterol levels, inferred from\nthe repression of genes regulated by the SREBF2 factor, reflected shifts in intracellular\nmetabolic balance. While these effects were consistent across microgravity and terrestrial\nconditions, their significance lies in demonstrating how human serum, as an external\nstimulus, can drive profound cellular changes independently of gravity.\nThese results reinforce the notion that certain fundamental processes in renal cells\nremain relatively stable under microgravity conditions during short-term exposures. How-\never, they also highlight the need for further research into prolonged microgravity en-\nvironments, where cellular adaptations may become more pronounced or clinically rele-\nvant [44,45].\nThe implications of these discoveries are significant for both space exploration and\nterrestrial medicine. In the context of spaceflight, the findings provide critical insights\ninto how kidneys might adapt to microgravity, ensuring that essential functions such as\nfiltration and blood compound regulation are maintained during extended missions. On\nEarth, these studies offer valuable perspectives on how kidney cells respond to metabolic\nand protein stress, potentially informing the development of advanced therapies for kidney\ndiseases [44] (Figure 3).\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n12 of 23\n5.5. Reproductive System Ovarian Follicles and Egg Quality\nSimulated microgravity has provided valuable insights into how this unique envi-\nronment impacts egg quality and ovarian follicle development. Ovarian follicles, which\nare critical for egg formation, rely on intricate interactions between granulosa cells and\nthe egg to ensure proper maturation. However, the specific effects of microgravity on\nthese interactions and the overall evolution of follicles have only recently begun to be\nunderstood [47].\nIn an experiment replicating microgravity conditions, ovarian follicles were cultured\nin a simulated system. The results indicated that while follicle growth and survival rates\nwere not significantly affected and remained comparable to those observed under normal\ngravity conditions, the quality of the eggs released was markedly reduced [47\u201349].\nElectron microscopy revealed alterations in the cellular structures responsible for\ncommunication between granulosa cells and the egg. These structural changes resulted in a\nloss of organization within the granulosa cells, disrupting the secretion of essential factors\nrequired for egg maturation. However, supplementing growth factors and antioxidants\nsignificantly improved egg quality, suggesting that the adverse effects of microgravity\ncould be mitigated through targeted interventions [47\u201349].\nFurther analysis of the eggs highlighted deficiencies in the distribution and density\nof cortical granules, structures vital for maturation. Additionally, there was a notable\nreduction in the number of eggs capable of releasing the first polar body\u2014a critical process\nin egg development. These deficiencies were linked to increased oxidative stress levels,\nwhich further contributed to the decline in egg quality [47\u201349].\nAnother key finding was the loss of polarity in granulosa cells, which inhibited the\nformation of cellular projections essential for interacting with the egg. This disruption\nimpaired communication between granulosa cells and the egg, negatively affecting the\nmaturation process. Moreover, microgravity altered the formation of microvilli in the egg,\nstructures crucial for interaction with surrounding cells. Eggs cultured under microgravity\nconditions exhibited a significant reduction in both the number and size of microvilli, po-\ntentially limiting their ability to release factors essential for development [47\u201349] (Figure 3).\n5.6. Cardiomyocyte Maturation and Functionality\nSimulated microgravity has been shown to significantly enhance the maturation and\nfunctionality of cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells. One of the\nmost notable improvements observed under these conditions is mitochondrial biogenesis,\na critical process for cellular maturation [9,10,23,50]. Mitochondrial biogenesis enables\ncells to produce energy more efficiently, a key factor for the proper functioning of mature\ncardiomyocytes. Experimental data have demonstrated an increase in mitochondrial\ncontent, evidenced by the expression of specific mitochondrial proteins and an elevated\nratio of mitochondrial DNA to nuclear DNA. These findings suggest that microgravity\nstimulates mitochondrial formation, improving the cells\u2019 capacity to generate ATP, the\nprimary energy source for cardiac function [6,50].\nIn addition to increased mitochondrial content, simulated microgravity enhances mito-\nchondrial respiration. This improvement, evidenced by elevated maximal respiration levels\nand ATP production, ensures the energy supply necessary for cardiomyocyte contraction\nand relaxation. These observations highlight the potential of microgravity to promote\nmetabolic maturation in cardiomyocytes, rendering them more functional and suitable for\ntherapeutic applications [6,50].\nAnother critical aspect influenced by microgravity is calcium handling, a vital process\nfor cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation. Cells cultured under microgravity exhibited\ngreater amplitude in calcium transients, reflecting enhanced calcium storage capacity in\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n13 of 23\nthe sarcoplasmic reticulum, a structure crucial for regulating intracellular calcium concen-\ntrations. Efficient calcium handling is essential for effective cardiac function, as it enables\nstronger and more coordinated muscle fiber contractions. These findings indicate that\ncardiomyocytes cultured in microgravity are not only more metabolically advanced but\nalso display improved functionality consistent with mature cardiomyocytes [6,50].\nSimulated microgravity also positively affects the structural properties of cardiomy-\nocytes. Observations include increased sarcomere length, the functional unit responsible\nfor muscle contraction, and longer Z-disks, key structures for transmitting contraction\nforces. Additionally, nuclear eccentricity and diameter were increased, further indicating a\nhigher degree of cellular maturation. These structural enhancements bring cardiomyocytes\ncultured in microgravity closer to the characteristics of fully functional human cardiac cells,\nreinforcing their ability to perform physiological functions effectively [6,50].\nThe duration of exposure to microgravity plays a pivotal role in maximizing these\nbenefits. Recent studies suggest that a 7-day exposure period is optimal for promoting\nsignificant improvements in cardiomyocyte maturation. Prolonged exposures of 14 days,\nhowever, did not yield additional benefits, indicating a specific time window for max-\nimizing the positive effects of microgravity. Optimizing culture conditions within this\ntimeframe is essential to achieve the best outcomes [50,51].\nAdvances in utilizing simulated microgravity to enhance cardiomyocyte maturation\nand functionality open new avenues in regenerative medicine, particularly for treating\ncardiac diseases such as myocardial infarctions. The ability to produce high-quality, mature\ncardiomyocytes is critical for developing effective cellular grafts capable of integrating\ninto damaged tissues and restoring cardiac functionality. These breakthroughs represent a\nsignificant step forward in biotechnology, with far-reaching implications for the treatment\nof cardiac pathologies [6,50,51] (Figure 3).\n6. Impacts on Stem Cells and Cell Regeneration\nMicrogravity has provided significant insights into how this environment influences\nfundamental biological processes such as tissue regeneration and cell repair [52,53]. Re-\nsearch conducted in real spaceflights and terrestrial simulations has demonstrated that\nmicrogravity impacts protein expression and the regulation of cellular pathways critical for\nthe growth and regeneration of various stem cell types. One of the most notable pathways\naffected is the Hippo pathway, which plays a central role in cell proliferation and tissue\ndamage response. Under microgravity conditions, this pathway is temporarily deactivated,\ncreating a favorable state for cell proliferation and tissue repair. These effects have shown\nparticular promise in regenerating organs such as the heart, with potential applications\nextending to other tissues [53,54].\nThe replication of microgravity effects in terrestrial simulations opens new possibilities\nfor exploring therapeutic treatments based on this phenomenon [17,52\u201354]. Findings sug-\ngest that microgravity could serve as a valuable tool for enhancing the regenerative capacity\nof stem cells without requiring invasive or complex technologies. Additionally, combining\nmicrogravity exposure with the use of certain drugs or microRNA manipulation\u2014key\nregulators of gene expression\u2014can amplify the activity of the Hippo pathway and YAP1\nprotein, further promoting tissue regeneration. These discoveries hold promise for treating\nheart diseases and repairing other damaged tissues and systems [53] (Figure 4).\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n14 of 23\nFigure 4. Microgravity effects on stem cell differentiation and regenerative potential. This figure\nillustrates key findings related to the effects of microgravity on stem cell behavior. Microgravity has\nbeen associated with enhanced cell proliferation, potentially contributing to tissue repair processes.\nAdditionally, it leads to the temporary deactivation of the Hippo pathway, involving upstream\nregulators such as MST1/2, SAV1, WWC1-3, LATS1/2, and MOB1, which in turn promotes the\nnuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ. Furthermore, microgravity influences hematopoietic stem cell\ndifferentiation by activating specific genes and pathways, including RUNX1, which is involved in\nstem cell establishment, SOX17, which plays a role in maintaining pluripotency, and GATA3, which is\ncrucial for megakaryocyte and erythrocyte maturation. The PI3K-Akt and mTOR pathways are also\nimplicated in this process, with STRIPAK acting as a modulatory factor.\nCells cultured under simulated microgravity using an RPM have shown significant\nalterations, enhancing our understanding of cellular responses to gravity loss. For example,\nthyroid carcinoma cells (FTC-133) formed three-dimensional spheroids, contrasting with\ntheir typical monolayer growth, and displayed changes in adhesion properties and internal\norganization consistent with spaceflight observations [23,24]. These morphological trans-\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n15 of 23\nformations involved cytoskeletal reorganization, particularly affecting actin filaments and\nmicrotubules, which are crucial for maintaining cellular integrity. Gene expression analysis\nrevealed changes in genes related to cellular adhesion and proliferation, including vascular en-\ndothelial growth factor (VEGF), E-cadherin, and vimentin. Moreover, T lymphocytes exposed\nto RPM-simulated microgravity exhibited decreased activation, mirroring the effects observed\nin spaceflight experiments. These findings validate the utility of RPMs for ground-based\nresearch on physiological changes relevant to long-duration spaceflight [24].\n6.1. Hematopoietic Differentiation\nSimulated microgravity significantly enhances the differentiation of human pluripo-\ntent stem cells into hematopoietic lineages, offering a promising avenue for regenerative\nmedicine and cell therapies [55\u201357]. Under microgravity conditions, hematopoietic stem\ncells demonstrate more efficient induction of endothelial hemogenic progenitors, leading\nto improved formation of functional three-dimensional structures. This results in a notable\nincrease in active hematopoietic cells, optimizing both cell expansion and differentiation\nprocesses [55\u201357].\nTranscriptomic analyses have identified the differential activation of thousands of\ngenes involved in hematopoiesis, including RUNX1, SOX17, and GATA1. RUNX1 is\nessential for establishing hematopoietic stem cells, SOX17 for maintaining pluripotency and\ndifferentiation into hematopoietic lineages, and GATA1 for the maturation of erythrocytes\nand megakaryocytes. These gene expression patterns suggest that microgravity creates a\nfavorable environment for optimizing hematopoiesis [55].\nAt the cellular level, microgravity influences DNA replication by promoting the ex-\npression of replication machinery genes such as helicases and polymerases. This enhances\nefficient cell division, a critical factor for hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differen-\ntiation. Furthermore, microgravity modulates the cell cycle, facilitating transitions through\nkey phases such as G1/S and G2/M, which are essential for cell proliferation [55\u201357].\nA key discovery is the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, which regulates cell\ngrowth, survival, and metabolism. This pathway modulates proteins such as mTOR, which\ngoverns cell growth and metabolism, and Bad, which inhibits apoptosis, ensuring the\nsurvival of hematopoietic progenitor cells. By promoting cell proliferation and preventing\nprogrammed cell death, the PI3K-Akt pathway plays a pivotal role in the development of\nfunctional hematopoietic cells [56,57].\nMicrogravity also enhances three-dimensional cellular organization, improving inter-\nactions between cells and their microenvironment. These interactions are vital for forming\nhematopoietic niches that replicate physiological conditions more accurately. Cultures\nin microgravity favor the creation of three-dimensional spheroids, which support better\ndifferentiation and functionality of hematopoietic stem cells, optimizing the hematopoiesis\nprocess. This capability is particularly valuable for developing precise experimental models\nand innovative cell therapies [14,55,56].\nMicrogravity modulates hematopoiesis by influencing the differentiation, prolifera-\ntion, and structural organization of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Pluripotent stem cells\nexhibit enhanced differentiation potential, increased proliferation, and improved structural\norganization, as microgravity optimizes conditions for hematopoietic progenitor expan-\nsion [17,58\u201362]. This occurs through survival signaling, primarily via PI3K-Akt pathway\nactivation, where increased Akt phosphorylation inhibits proapoptotic proteins such as\nBAD and enhances cell survival via antiapoptotic mechanisms linked to mTOR. Wnt/\u03b2-\ncatenin signaling is also dynamically regulated in microgravity, promoting \u03b2-catenin accu-\nmulation in the cytoplasm and its nuclear translocation, activating genes essential for stem\ncell self-renewal and differentiation. Additionally, microgravity modulates Notch path-\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n16 of 23\nway interactions and transcription factors like RUNX1, crucial for hematopoietic lineage\ncommitment. Structural rearrangements in hematopoietic niches under microgravity alter\ncell-to-cell interactions and adhesion molecule expression, facilitating the three-dimensional\norganization of hematopoietic clusters. On a physiological level, microgravity-induced\nmetabolic adjustments enhance responsiveness to hypoxic stimuli, promoting hematopoi-\netic maturation. These findings underscore the potential of microgravity-based systems\nto refine cell culture techniques and provide insights into spaceflight\u2019s effects on human\nhematopoietic function [17,18].\n6.2. Cell Proliferation and Regenerative Therapies\nMicrogravity significantly influences cell proliferation and functionality, representing\na transformative advancement for biomedical research and regenerative medicine [63,64].\nIn studies with pancreatic islets and neural crest stem cells, exposure to microgravity\nnotably enhanced cell proliferation, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) cultures. For\ninstance, pancreatic beta cells exhibited a 45% increase in proliferation after two weeks of\nmicrogravity exposure compared to controls under normal gravity conditions [63,65].\nMicrogravity not only boosts cell growth but also modulates specific functions. For\nexample, pancreatic beta cells cultured under microgravity showed a significant increase in\ninsulin secretion, suggesting potential applications in developing therapies for metabolic\ndiseases such as diabetes [66]. Furthermore, co-culturing stem cells with pancreatic islets\nunder microgravity improved cell viability by 20%, highlighting its ability to create a\nfavorable environment for cell development [63,67].\nThe formation of three-dimensional structures under microgravity is a critical aspect\nof these improvements. Unlike two-dimensional cultures, 3D models more accurately repli-\ncate human physiological conditions, allowing for complex cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013environment\ninteractions essential for differentiation, proliferation, and functionality. Beta cells in 3D\nmodels not only proliferated more rapidly but also maintained enhanced functionality, as\ndemonstrated by increased insulin secretion [63,66].\nAt the molecular level, microgravity appears to modulate key signaling pathways,\nsuch as PI3K-Akt and mTOR, which regulate cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism.\nWhile further studies are needed to confirm their specific roles in beta cells and neural\ncrest stem cells, these findings underscore microgravity\u2019s ability to influence fundamental\nprocesses and optimize cell culture conditions [63,65].\nMicrogravity offers a unique environment that enhances cell proliferation, viability,\nand functionality in 3D models, with direct applications in regenerative medicine. This\nenvironment not only promotes cell growth but also improves the functional quality of cells,\nwhich can significantly advance the development of cell therapies. For instance, pancreatic\nislets cultured under microgravity conditions could exhibit superior efficacy in transplants\nfor diabetes patients, demonstrating increased proliferation and functional capacity, which\ncould greatly enhance therapeutic outcomes [63,67].\n7. Impact on Pathogen Virulence\nMicrogravity, whether experienced during spaceflight or simulated in terrestrial mod-\nels, induces significant changes in the genetic expression and physiology of pathogens\naffecting both humans and plants. These changes have profound implications for astronaut\nhealth, space exploration, and the prevention of foodborne illnesses in space environ-\nments [15,68,69].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n17 of 23\n7.1. Increased Pathogen Virulence and Resistance\nUnder microgravity conditions, bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella enterica and\nEscherichia coli exhibit increased virulence, antibiotic resistance, stress tolerance, and biofilm\nformation. This is often accompanied by a reduced median lethal dose (LD50) in animal\nmodels. For instance, Salmonella Typhimurium cultured under simulated microgravity\ndemonstrated fivefold higher lethality in mice compared to cultures grown under normal\ngravity. Additionally, these pathogens have been observed to evade and suppress plant\ninnate immunity, enabling colonization of intracellular spaces. While these processes are\nalso observed on Earth, it remains unclear whether microgravity enhances these capabilities\nor merely facilitates their study [15,16].\n7.2. Molecular Mechanisms Driving Virulence\nMicrogravity alters extracellular nutrient transport and activates molecular pathways\nthat enhance bacterial virulence. A key factor is low fluid shear, a physical stimulus that\nmimics microgravity environments and is also present in human microenvironments such\nas the gastrointestinal tract. Low fluid shear conditions favor the expression of stress\ntolerance and virulence-related genes, including those linked to the type III secretion\nsystem (TS3) and iron metabolism regulation. For example, Salmonella Typhimurium ex-\nposed to microgravity shows increased tolerance to acidic conditions and upregulation\nof genes controlled by Fur, a critical regulator of iron acquisition and virulence in enteric\npathogens [15,68,69].\n7.3. Effects on Biofilm Formation and Stress Response\nMicrogravity also influences the transport of oxygen and phosphates due to the\nabsence of convection, replicating conditions similar to those in human infections. These\nenvironmental changes impact gene expression related to stress tolerance and virulence. For\ninstance, Escherichia coli demonstrates enhanced biofilm formation and increased expression\nof genes responsible for host cell adherence and lesion formation, thereby amplifying its\npathogenic potential. However, these effects are not universal; variations in results suggest\nthat the impact of microgravity depends on the pathogen type, culture medium, and\nspecific experimental conditions [15,16].\nA recurring observation across multiple studies is the decreased expression of Hfq,\na key regulatory protein involved in stress response and virulence. Hfq plays a critical\nrole in the adaptation of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens under stress\nconditions, including microgravity. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms involving\nHfq could provide insights into mitigating the risks of pathogen virulence during prolonged\nspace missions [15,16].\nMicrogravity significantly affects interactions between human pathogens and plants,\nincreasing bacterial virulence and compromising plant defense mechanisms. For example,\npathogens under microgravity conditions demonstrate an enhanced ability to suppress\nplant immune responses, facilitating colonization and intracellular persistence [53\u201357].\nThese effects underscore the importance of investigating pathogen behavior in extreme\nconditions to develop strategies that mitigate health risks in space environments [15,16].\n8. Discussion\nRecent research demonstrates that microgravity significantly influences a wide array\nof biological processes, including immune responses, cell proliferation, and tissue regenera-\ntion.

Alterations\nin cellular biology under microgravity conditions have been shown to affect diseases\nsuch as cancer, osteoporosis, kidney dysfunction, and infertility. Additionally, changes\nobserved in endothelial cell behavior and multi-organ homeostasis highlight microgravity\u2019s\npotential to revolutionize regenerative medicine and deepen our understanding of human\nphysiology in extreme environments.\nMicrogravity also holds significant promise for personalized medicine by facilitating\nprogress in regenerative therapies, immune-based treatments, and approaches to managing\nchronic diseases. These findings emphasize microgravity\u2019s transformative potential to\nreshape cellular biology and its application to contemporary medical challenges, both in\nspace and on Earth.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n19 of 23\nAs a defining characteristic of space environments, microgravity imposes profound\nand multidimensional effects on biological and physiological systems, challenging con-\nventional notions of human adaptation. The near-total absence of gravitational forces\ndisrupts numerous bodily processes, posing risks to health during and after space missions.\nKey effects include fluid redistribution, increased intracranial pressure, muscle atrophy,\nand calcium-related bone density loss. At the molecular level, microgravity alters gene\nexpression, cell signaling, and mitochondrial function, with significant consequences for\nenergy production and cellular health [37\u201339].\nIn the immune system, microgravity reduces T cell activity and suppresses immune\nresponses, increasing susceptibility to infections. These effects highlight the necessity of\nmitigating immune dysfunction during space travel. Similarly, studies have documented\nchanges in the human microbiome, with potential implications for astronaut health and\nnutritional strategies during prolonged missions.\nMicrogravity research has also led to technological and medical breakthroughs with\napplications beyond space exploration. For instance, the study of proteins and drug\ncrystals under microgravity has produced purer and more stable structures, offering new\ntherapeutic possibilities for chronic diseases. Additionally, materials research in space has\ncontributed to the development of innovative compounds with applications in both space\nand terrestrial industries. These advancements enhance the safety and efficiency of space\nmissions while delivering broad scientific and technological benefits [39,40].\nDespite these advances, the complex effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity\nunderline the need for further research, particularly in anticipation of missions to Mars\nand other distant destinations. Experimental models, such as space platforms and terres-\ntrial simulators, remain indispensable tools for understanding the long-term impacts of\nmicrogravity and developing effective countermeasures [37,49].\nThe study of microgravity not only expands our understanding of how the human\nbody adapts to extreme environments but also drives innovations with profound implica-\ntions for science, medicine, and technology. By pushing the boundaries of what is known,\nthis research establishes itself as a cornerstone for advancements that extend beyond space\nexploration, reshaping our perspectives on biology and human health [37,40].\n9. Conclusions\nMicrogravity presents a unique and multifaceted challenge for human biology, pro-\nfoundly influencing cellular systems and physiological processes. This environment, dis-\ntinct from terrestrial conditions, disrupts key biological functions such as immune activity,\ncell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby destabilizing\nhomeostasis critical for human health.\nEmerging research has highlighted the diverse effects of microgravity, including its\nimpact on the immune system, where T cell function diminishes, increasing susceptibility to\ninfections. Additionally, cancer cells exhibit altered behavior under microgravity, providing\nnew insights into tumor progression and potential therapeutic approaches. These findings\nunderscore the need for further investigation into how microgravity influences disease\nmechanisms and treatment responses.\nMicrogravity also affects the physiology of vital organs, such as the liver, kidneys,\nand bones, with implications for understanding tissue regeneration. Notably, stem cells\nexposed to microgravity demonstrate enhanced potential to produce mature, functional\ncells such as cardiomyocytes, offering transformative possibilities in regenerative medicine\nfor repairing damaged cardiac tissue and other applications.\nThe continued exploration of microgravity\u2019s effects is essential not only for safeguard-\ning astronaut health during prolonged space missions but also for advancing therapeutic\nInt.

However, contemporary studies have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell\npools, and a novel culturing technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell\nproliferation which are highly functional. Here, we report the preservation of stemness in human\nadipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) by using microgravity conditions combined with microspheres\nin a stirred suspension. The cells were bound to microspheres (100\u2212300 \u00b5m) and cultured using a\nwave-stirring shaker. One-week cultures using polystyrene and collagen microspheres increased\nthe proportions of SSEA-3(+) hASCs 4.4- and 4.3-fold (2.7- and 2.9-fold increases in their numbers),\nrespectively, compared to normal culture conditions. These cultured hASCs expressed higher levels\nof pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, and KLF), and had improved abilities for\nproliferation, colony formation, network formation, and multiple-mesenchymal differentiation. We\nbelieve that this novel culturing method may further enhance regenerative therapies using hASCs.\nKeywords: adipose-derived stem cell; microgravity culture; polystyrene microsphere; collagen\nmicrosphere; multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring cell\n1. Introduction\nHuman adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) are easily isolated therapeutic stem cells\nfrom adipose tissue. They have increasingly been used to ameliorate a broad range of\nrefractory diseases, including irradiated tissue [1], ischemic wounds [2], and diabetic\nulcers [3]. However, their clinical ef\ufb01cacy has been limited because the long-term survival\nof transplanted hASCs is diminished by environmental stress [4\u20136]. Consequently, hASC\ntherapeutic mechanisms have been limited to the secretion of cytokines and growth factors\nto promote cell recruitment, immunomodulation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and\nangiogenesis [7\u201310]. In contrast, embryonic stem cells retain their potency and are thought\nto be superior to adult stem cells for regenerative potential [11]. However, the use of\nembryonic stem cells is limited by ethical issues [12].\nModern research has made gains toward a better understanding of stem-cell hetero-\ngeneity [13,14]. Within stem-cell pools (previously thought to be homogenous), a surprising\ndegree of subpopulation dynamics in gene expression has been revealed related to tissue\nregeneration, cell survival, proliferation, and stemness [15]. This concept of functional\nindividuality within a stem-cell pool is especially important for hASCs, because cells with\nhigher functional properties would be expected to have more promising therapeutic bene-\n\ufb01ts through an increased capacity to survive under dif\ufb01cult conditions, to differentiate into\nvarious mesenchymal cell types, and to home into damaged tissues [16\u201318]. One example\nCells 2021, 10, 560. https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10030560\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/cells\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n2 of 18\nof a highly functional hASC candidate is the multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring\n(Muse) cell, which can be isolated from hASCs using its expression of stage-speci\ufb01c em-\nbryonic antigen-3 (SSEA-3) [19] and has been reported to have novel potential for liver\ncirrhosis [20], brain infarction [21], and aortic aneurysm [22] treatments.\nAn additional problem is that the expansion of such highly-pluripotent cell popu-\nlations is quite dif\ufb01cult. Adhesion-based cultures, the standard technique for in vitro\nexpansion of hASCs, are known to lead to a gradual quiescence in stemness indicated,\nfor example, by a decline in CD34 positivity [23]. In contrast, suspension-type cultures\nhave also been used successfully for temporary cultivations of Muse cells, and although\nthe mechanism is unknown, it has been reported that a microgravity (i.e., weightless)\nenvironment had a positive effect on stem-cell cultures for maintenance of their original\npotencies [24]. However, the forced-\ufb02oating of hASC cultures using non-adherent dishes\ncaused spherical aggregations and oxygen/nutrient diffusion limits, which resulted in\ncentral necrosis in hASC spheroids [25]. There is, therefore, an urgent need for new and ad-\nvanced culture techniques to permit the selective expansion of hASC subpopulations with\nimproved properties for proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, immunosuppression,\nand stress-resistance.\nThe microcarrier system was \ufb01rst introduced in 1967 for the growth of \ufb01broblasts [26],\nand has been used for the expansion of other adherent cells such as chondrocytes [27],\nhepatocytes [28], neural stem cells [29], and hASCs [30,31]. Microcarriers are usually\nsmall spherical particles which can adhere to cultivated cells and are characterized by\nhigher surface-to-volume ratios that can accommodate higher cell densities compared\nto monolayer cultures. Most importantly, under the dynamic conditions of continuous\nshaking, microcarrier culturing has a multidirectional gravity effect on the adhered cells,\neffectively mimicking \ufb02oating cultures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate\nthe ability of dynamic microgravity culturing of hASCs using microcarriers to selectively\nexpand highly functional stem-cell subpopulations.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Primary Culture of hASCs\nHuman lipoaspirates were obtained from 12 healthy female donors, average age\n42.2 \u00b1 9.3 years (mean \u00b1 SD) and average body mass index of 22.4 \u00b1 1.8 kg/m2, who\nunderwent abdominal liposuction. Each patient provided written informed consent, and\nthe research protocol was approved by the institutional review board. The stromal vascular\nfraction (SVF) was isolated from the lipoaspirates as described previously [23]. Brie\ufb02y,\naspirated fat tissue was digested using 0.075% collagenase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries,\nOsaka, Japan) at 37 \u25e6C for 30 min on a shaker. After centrifugation (800\u00d7 g for 10 min),\nSVF cells were obtained as cellular pellets, \ufb01ltered through 100, 70, and 40 \u00b5m mesh, and\nresuspended. The SVF cells were plated at a density of 5 \u00d7 105 nucleated cells/100 mm\ndish and cultured at 37 \u25e6C in an atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide in humid air. Cells\nwere grown in Dulbecco\u2019s Modi\ufb01ed Eagle Medium with Ham\u2019s F-12 (DMEM/F12; Wako\nPure Chemical Industries) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary cells were\ncultured until near con\ufb02uence. Then, the adherent cells were released using a proteolytic\nenzyme treatment (TrypLE Express, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), de\ufb01ned as passage\n0 (P0) hASCs, and transferred to another dish. Once the adherent hASCs reached 80%\ncon\ufb02uency, cells were passaged using TrypLE Express, and P3 hASCs were used in the\nfollowing experiments. Using a multicolor \ufb02ow cytometer (MACS-Quant, Miltenyi Biotec,\nBergisch Gladbach, Germany), P3 hASCs were characterized for the positive expressions of\nCD73, CD90, and CD105 and the negative expression of CD45 before use.\n2.2. Characterization of SSEA-3-Positive Cells in the hASC Pool\nFirst, SSEA-3 marker expression was assessed in normal hASCs using \ufb02ow cytometry.\nAdherent P3 hASCs from each donor were detached using TrypLE Express, centrifuged,\nand washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were sieved through 100\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n3 of 18\nand 40 \u00b5m mesh \ufb01lters, pelleted by centrifugation, and then resuspended for analysis.\nThe isolated cells were incubated with rat anti-SSEA-3 antibody (1:50; BioLegend, San\nDiego, CA, USA) and detected using an \ufb02uorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat\nIgM (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). Analyses were performed using a multicolor\n\ufb02ow cytometer (MACS-Quant). Control gates were set based on staining with a labeled\nnon-speci\ufb01c antibody (matched isotype control immunoglobulin G (IgG)); no more than\n0.1% of the cells were deemed positive using the non-speci\ufb01c antibody.\nTo assess the stress durability of SSEA-3-positive cells, adherent P3 hASCs were ex-\nposed to a variety of optimized stress conditions (heat, 45 \u25e6C for 1 min; low-pH solution\n(pH = 5) for 60 min; proteolysis, TrypLE Express for 20 h at 37 \u25e6C; hypotonia, Milli-Q\nwater for 1 min; and mechanostress, transferred 30 times between two syringes through\na connector with a small hole). One day after stress exposure, cell numbers and viability\nwere measured using a dual-\ufb02uorescence automated cell counter (Luna-FL, Logos Biosys-\ntems, Gyeonggi-do, Korea), and SSEA-3 positivity was detected by \ufb02ow cytometry after\ngating dead cells from live cells using 7-amino-actinomycin D (7AAD, BD Biosciences)\n\ufb02uorescence (n = 12).\n2.3. Preparation of Microspheres\nTwo kinds of microspheres were used as cell carriers during cell culture. First, crosslinked\npolystyrene microspheres (Polystyrene Beads Large, Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA)\nwith diameters between 200\u2212300 \u00b5m were used. For good cell attachment, the polystyrene\nsurfaces were hydrophilized using a 30 min plasma treatment from a vacuum plasma\napparatus (YHS-D\u03d5S, Sakigake-Semiconductor, Kyoto, Japan). Ten grams of polystyrene\nmicrospheres (approximately 2.4 million microbeads with a total surface area of 4000 cm2)\nwere washed three times in 70% ethanol for sterilization and diluted in 15 mL of PBS.\nSecondly, collagen microspheres (100\u2212200 \u00b5m diameters, Cellagen; Koken, Tokyo, Japan)\nmanufactured from reconstituted collagen obtained from bovine skin and crosslinked\nwith 0.5% hexamethylene diisocyanate were used. Pre-sterilized vials (15 mL) contained\napproximately three million collagen beads with a total surface area of approximately\n4000 cm2.\n2.4. hASC Loading onto Microspheres for Microgravity Culture\nThe two types of microspheres were washed with PBS and resuspended in warm\nculture medium overnight (DMEM/F12) prior to use. Polystyrene and collagen micro-\nsphere solutions (0.3 mL), representing a total surface area of approximately 80 cm2, were\nadded to 3.5 cm diameter, non-adherent, polystyrene dishes (Corning Inc., Corning, NY,\nUSA). The dishes were placed onto a continuous-action shaker (Wave-PR, Taitec, Saitama,\nJapan), capable of shaking the microspheres in three dimensions by combining movements\nfrom two axes (rotary and seesaw). As a result, the cumulative gravity vector toward the\nmicrospheres was minimized towards zero (i.e., microgravity). The unit was driven by a\ncomputer system which allowed for the adjustment of rotation speed and shaking angle\n(see Video S1).\nFor each dish on the shaker, 1 \u00d7 105 P3 hASCs were suspended in 300 \u00b5L of DMEM/F12\nand incubated at 37 \u25e6C in an atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide in humid air. After allowing\nthe mixture of cells and microcarriers to settle for 30 min, 2 min of shaking was started at a\nsetting of 10 rpm and a shaking angle of 6 degrees, and then stopped for a further 28 min.\nThis 30 min procedure was repeated eight times (4 h total) to allow the cells to adhere to the\nmicrospheres circumferentially. Then, DMEM/F12 was added (1.5 mL) and the suspension\nwas stirred continuously at 15 rpm at a 6\u25e6shaking angle. Using this continuous stirring,\nthe cells experienced a microgravity environment while being strongly attached to the\nmicrospheres. Culturing continued for up to two weeks, and the culture medium was\nchanged twice per week as follows; after allowing the microspheres to settle, half of the\nsupernatant was exchanged for fresh medium.\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n4 of 18\n2.5. Cell Retrieval from Microspheres\nWhen ready for analysis, the cell\u2013microcarrier complexes obtained from the culture\ndishes were transferred to new tubes (15 mL) and sedimented. For each tube, the super-\nnatant was removed, and the complexes were washed using PBS. Cells were enzymatically\nreleased by incubation with 5 mL of TrypLE Express for 15 min at 37 \u25e6C. Cell suspensions\nwere diluted with additional culture medium (5 mL) and sieved through 100 and 40 \u00b5m\nmesh collector screens. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 600\u00d7 g for 5 min, and then\nresuspended for analysis. No microcarriers (fractured or intact) were seen in the retrieved\ncell suspensions.\n2.6. Cell Growth in Microsphere Cultures\nNumerical measurement of viable cells cultured on polystyrene and collagen micro-\nspheres, or in polystyrene and collagen dishes was carried out using a dual-\ufb02uorescence\nautomated cell counter (Luna-FL). P3 hASCs (1 \u00d7 105) were seeded onto polystyrene and\ncollagen microspheres under dynamic conditions, or onto polystyrene and collagen dishes\nas static monolayer cultures. The cells were retrieved by trypsinization and counted on\ndays 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14, and growth rates were calculated (i.e., hASC growth rate = hASC\nnumber on day 7/day 1). Data were gathered from six separate samples. Visualizations of\nhASCs cultured on polystyrene and collagen microspheres were carried out on day 7 using\na light microscope (Leica DM-LB, Wetzlar, Germany) and a scanning electron microscope\n(SEM; S-3500N, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at a beam energy of 25 kV. For the observing the\ncollagen microspheres, a cryo-SEM technique at \u2212130 \u25e6C was used so as not to scatter and\nlose uncharged microspheres.\n2.7. Proliferation of SSEA-3-Positive hASCs in Microsphere Cultures\nTo determine whether microsphere culturing and/or dynamic conditions enhanced\nthe proliferation of highly functional hASCs, we assessed cell number, viability, and SSEA-\n3-positivity using \ufb02ow cytometry in six groups: hASCs retrieved from either polystyrene or\ncollagen microcarriers under dynamic conditions, those retrieved from either polystyrene or\ncollagen microcarriers under static conditions, and those retrieved from either polystyrene\nor collagen dishes. The number of SSEA-3(+) cells was measured after seven days of\nculture under each condition, and growth rates were calculated (i.e., SSEA-3(+) growth\nrate = SSEA-3(+) cell number on day 7/day 0). Six separate samples were used for the\ndata analysis.\n2.8. Immunocytochemistry\nP3 hASCs were cultured for seven days on polystyrene or collagen microspheres, and\nin polystyrene or collagen dishes, \ufb01xed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in PBS, and\npermeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were\nincubated for 16 h (4 \u25e6C) with the following primary antibodies: anti-OCT4 (GeneTex,\nIrvine, CA, USA); anti-SOX2 (GeneTex); anti-NANOG (N3C3, GeneTex); and anti-SSEA-3\n(EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). All primary antibodies were diluted 1:200 in a\nsolution of PBS/0.1% bovine serum albumin. Appropriate secondary antibodies (1:200\ndilutions of either goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 594, goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor\n488, or goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 594) were incubated with cells for 1 h at room temperature.\nFinally, cells were washed with PBS and treated with Hoechst 33342 (1:500; Dojindo,\nKumamoto, Japan) for 10 min. Stained cells were visualized as 30 \u00b5m Z-stack \ufb02uorescence\nimages collected in 1.5 \u00b5m steps taken by a \ufb02uorescence-equipped microscope (Keyence,\nOsaka, Japan).\n2.9. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)\nTotal RNA was isolated from hASCs cultured with either polystyrene or collagen\nmicrospheres under dynamic conditions, polystyrene or collagen microspheres under static\nconditions, and from those cultured on normal polystyrene dishes (control) for seven days\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n5 of 18\nusing an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by reverse transcription.\nRT-PCR was performed using a StepOnePlus RT-PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scienti\ufb01c,\nWaltham, MA, USA) using a fast SYBR Green PCR master mix (Thermo Fisher Scienti\ufb01c)\nand the primers listed in Table 1. Expression levels were calculated by a comparative CT\nmethod relative to a common endogenous reference gene, ACTB. Data were taken from\nthree separate samples.\nTable 1.

Colony-Forming Assay\nP3 hASCs were cultured either with polystyrene or collagen microspheres under\ndynamic conditions or in polystyrene dishes for seven days, and then seeded (1 \u00d7 102 cells)\ninto polystyrene 6-well plates. Cells were incubated at 37 \u25e6C for ten days, \ufb01xed with\nmethanol, stained with cresyl violet solution, and then counted using digital imaging\nsoftware (Photoshop; Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) (n = 6).\n2.11. In Vitro Angiogenesis (Network Formation) Assay\nP3 hASCs were cultured either with polystyrene or collagen microspheres under\ndynamic conditions or in polystyrene dishes for seven days, and then cell-network for-\nmation was assessed. Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was applied to 96-well plates (50 \u00b5L per\nwell) and polymerized (30 min at 37 \u25e6C). After incubation in endothelial basal medium\n(EBM; Cambrex, Walkersville, MD, USA) containing 2% fetal bovine serum for 24 h as\na pretreatment, 5000 cells (resuspended in 50 \u00b5L of EBM) were plated into the Matrigel\nwells and cultured for 6 h. Branch formation was observed with phase microscopy, and the\nlengths of cytoplasmic extensions per \ufb01eld were calculated (n = 6).\n2.12. Multilineage Differentiation Assay\nP3 hASCs were cultured either with polystyrene or collagen microspheres under dy-\nnamic conditions or in polystyrene dishes for seven days, and then differentiated into adi-\npogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages (n = 3). Cells were seeded into polystyrene\n6-well plates and incubated in DMEM/F12 until con\ufb02uent. Adipogenic/osteogenic differ-\nentiation was initiated using either adipogenic medium (Adipolife; Lifeline Cell Technology,\nFrederick, MD, USA) or osteogenic medium (Osteolife; Lifeline Cell Technology). After\nculturing for 21 days (medium changed every three days), adipogenic ability was analyzed\nqualitatively with oil red O staining and quantitatively with AdipoRed reagent (Lonza,\nBasel, Switzerland). Osteogenic ability was analyzed qualitatively using von Kossa staining\nand quantitatively by Calcium-E testing (Wako Pure Chemicals). Chondrogenic differen-\ntiation was conducted using a micromass culture system; hASCs were resuspended in\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n6 of 18\nchondrogenic medium (Chondrolife; Lifeline Cell Technology) and centrifuged (800\u00d7 g\nfor 5 min). Half of the medium was changed after centrifugation every two days. After\ntwo weeks, chondrogenic ability was analyzed qualitatively using Alcian blue staining and\nquantitatively by measuring micromass diameters.\n2.13. Statistics\nData were analyzed using SPSS package 23.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and\nKyplot 2.0 (Freeware). Based on the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, the data were normally dis-\ntributed within the donor populations. Therefore, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)\nand Bonferroni adjustments for post-hoc comparisons were used to determine signi\ufb01cant\ndifferences between means (p < 0.05 representing signi\ufb01cance, unless otherwise stated).\n3. Results\n3.1. Characterization of SSEA-3-Positive hASCs\nCells were expanded for three passages before characterization using \ufb02ow cytometry\nand combinations of mesenchymal-cell surface markers. We found that 94.9 \u00b1 3.3% of\ncells were positive for CD105, CD90, and CD73, and that 99.5 \u00b1 0.3% were negative for\nCD45. Then, the total number of cells, their viability, and SSEA-3-positivity of viable cells\nwere assessed in normal hASCs (control) and in \ufb01ve kinds of stress-treated hASCs. One\nday after stress exposure, even though all stressed groups showed signi\ufb01cant reductions\n(62.4\u201374.2%) in viable cells compared to the control group, stressed cells exhibited higher\nproportions of SSEA-3(+) cells (heat, 2.1%; low pH, 3.1%; proteolysis, 4.2%; hypotonia, 2.2%;\nmechanostress, 1.4%) compared to controls (1.3%) (Figure 1A). No signi\ufb01cant differences\nwere detected in the overall numbers of SSEA-3(+) cells between stress-treated hASCs\nand normal hASCs, with the exception of the mechanostress group, which showed a\nsigni\ufb01cantly lower number of SSEA-3(+) cells (p < 0.01) (Figure 1B,C).\n3.2. Cell Growth in Microgravity Microsphere Cultures\nAdherent cells are continuously affected by the downward force of gravity throughout\nthe culture period, but cells attached to continuously stirred microspheres are affected by\nmultidirectional gravitational forces (i.e., microgravity) (Figure 2A). The numbers of hASCs\nwere decreased in both polystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures on day 1, suggesting\nthat some cells did not successfully adhere to the microbeads (Figure 2B). However, the\ngrowth rates (i.e., hASC number on day 7/day 1) used to estimate true cell proliferation\nshowed no signi\ufb01cant differences between groups (polystyrene microsphere, 6.0; collagen\nmicrosphere, 6.0; polystyrene dish, 5.7; collagen dish, 5.8). On day 14, there were no\nsigni\ufb01cant differences in the numbers of hASCs retrieved from each culture, possibly\nbecause the monolayer cultures reached con\ufb02uency. Visualizations of hASCs that were\nadhered to polystyrene and collagen microspheres at culture-day 7 revealed their successful\nproliferation (Figure 2C).\n3.3. Proliferation of SSEA-3-Positive hASCs in Microgravity/Microsphere Cultures\nAs described above, the numbers of viable hASCs on day 7 were lower in the\nmicrosphere-cultured groups, regardless of the material (polystyrene or collagen) or the\ncondition (dynamic or static), compared to the dish-cultured groups (Figure 3A). However,\nwhen compared to polystyrene monolayer cultures (as controls), the static-condition\npolystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures produced 2.3-fold and 2.2-fold propor-\ntional increases, and 1.2-fold and 1.3-fold increases in the numbers of SSEA-3(+) hASCs,\nrespectively (p < 0.05 for both). In addition, the dynamic-culture conditions produced\n4.4-fold and 4.3-fold proportional increases, and 2.7-fold and 2.9-fold increases in the\nnumbers of SSEA-3(+) hASCs compared to the dish cultures, respectively (p < 0.001 for\nboth) (Figure 3B,C). These results indicate positive effects for both the microsphere and\nmicrogravity conditions on SSEA-3(+) cell proliferation and on SSEA-3(+) cell growth rates\n(i.e., growth rate = SSEA-3(+) cell number on day 7/day 0) Table 2.\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n7 of 18\nFigure 1.

By comparison, the hASCs cultured in both polystyrene and collagen\nmonolayer cultures stained either negative, or weakly positive, for these stemness markers.\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n9 of 18\nFigure 3.

Selected Gene Expression Analysis by RT-PCR\nWe used RT-PCR to compare the expression of several genes involved with stemness\nand mesenchymal differentiation in hASCs from microgravity/microsphere cultures to\ntheir expressions in hASCs from dish cultures (n = 3). The hASCs cultured with polystyrene\nmicrospheres under dynamic conditions exhibited signi\ufb01cantly upregulated OCT4, SOX2,\nKLF4, and CD34 expressions, while hASCs cultured with collagen microspheres under\ndynamic conditions showed up-regulations of SOX2, NANOG, MYC, KLF4, and CD34 ex-\npressions (Figure 5). In contrast, hASCs from microsphere cultures under static conditions\n(both polystyrene and collagen) displayed no statistically signi\ufb01cant differences for all the\ngenes examined.\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n10 of 18\n \nFigure 4.

Colony-Forming Assay\nAfter 10 days of culture with an initial seeding of 1 \u00d7 102 cells per well, we counted cell\ncolonies as an estimate of proliferative ability. We found a signi\ufb01cantly higher number of\ncolonies in the polystyrene microsphere group (p = 0.027) and in the collagen microsphere\ngroup (p = 0.025) compared to the polystyrene dish group (n = 6) (Figure 6).\nFigure 6.

In Vitro Angiogenesis Assay\nThe network-formation assay showed that hASCs cultured with polystyrene and col-\nlagen microspheres formed complex, capillary-like networks more quickly and intricately\nthan dish-cultured hASCs (Figure 7A). Accordingly, the lengths of cytoplasmic extensions\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n12 of 18\nwere also signi\ufb01cantly longer in the polystyrene- and collagen-microsphere groups com-\npared to the dish group (p < 0.001), whereas the microsphere material (polystyrene or\ncollagen) had no signi\ufb01cant effect (Figure 7B).\n \nFigure 7.

Multilineage Differentiation Assay\nBased on lineage-speci\ufb01c differentiations, hASCs that were cultured on polystyrene\nand collagen microspheres displayed higher levels of adipogenic and osteogenic differenti-\nation compared to hASCs cultured in polystyrene dishes (controls) using intracellular lipid\ncontent (adipogenic) and calcium deposition (osteogenic) assessments (Figure 8). However,\nwhile hASCs cultured on collagen microspheres did display higher levels of chondro-\ngenic differentiation compared to controls, those cultured on polystyrene microspheres\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n13 of 18\nshowed similar chondrogenic differentiation compared to controls using an assessment of\ncartilage\u2013micromass diameters.\nFigure 8.

Discussions\nThrough novel advances in cell biology, adult stem cells (including hASCs) have\nbeen shown to be truly heterogeneous, with subpopulations of cells that may offer poten-\ntially greater translational bene\ufb01ts. SSEA-3(+) Muse cells, a representative type of highly\nfunctional mesenchymal stem cell, are known to show superior multipotency compared\nto regular stem cells [32]. However, although routine two-dimensional cultures allow\nhASCs to expand easily, these conditions adversely affect the proliferation of cells with\nhigher multipotent properties, reducing the usual proportion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs to only\napproximately 1% [19]. Growing evidence suggests that mechanical and environmental\nstress greatly in\ufb02uences proliferation, self-renewal, differentiation, and the multipotency\nof stem cells [33,34]. Among possible sources of stress, gravity may historically have been\nthe most underappreciated microenvironment stress, because of its constant in\ufb02uence on\ncultured cells.\nNumerous studies have reported the impact of microgravity conditions on stem-cell\nproliferation [35] and differentiation [36,37]. Notably, human mesenchymal stem cells cul-\ntured in a microgravity environment usually demonstrate suppressed differentiation [38].\nTherefore, some highly functional stem cells may be able to retain their undifferentiated,\nunaltered phenotypes if they can avoid the force of gravity during culture. According to\nprevious studies, controlled rotation around two axes can minimize the cumulative gravity\nvector to an average of 10\u22123\u00d7 g over time [24]. In our experimental system, although\ncells were attached to microsphere surfaces, the culture medium containing the micro-\nspheres was stirred by controlled rotation around two axes. As a result, the cells\u2019 gravity\nvectors were randomly and continuously changing, with their \ufb01nal cumulative gravity\nvectors being minimized toward zero. Some microgravity-simulating devices have been\ndeveloped [39,40], but they involve signi\ufb01cant costs and are very dif\ufb01cult to standardize.\nMoreover, even such devices created large cell clusters which represent the limit of cell-\nproliferative capacity [25] and reinforce the advantage of the present adhesive conditions\nfor the large-scale expansion of hASCs [41].\nIn previous studies, micro-scale carriers fabricated from a variety of natural and syn-\nthetic polymers have shown signi\ufb01cant potential for cell growth, speci\ufb01c differentiation,\nand the delivery of hASCs [42,43]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no investigation\nhas been carried out on the feasibility of culturing cells using stirred microspheres for the\nstated purpose of mimicking a microgravity environment. The outcomes of this study\nexceeded our expectations. Seven days of polystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures\nunder static conditions produced an increased number of SSEA-3(+) hASCs compared to\npolystyrene dish cultures, and those under dynamic conditions exhibited a much higher\nnumber of SSEA-3(+) hASCs. These results clearly revealed a positive in\ufb02uence of micro-\nspheres on the selective proliferation of SSEA-3(+) cells, especially in those experiments\ncombined with a microgravity environment.\nBy comparison, our stress-exposure treatments were not very suitable for the expan-\nsion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs. Heneidi et al. reported that Muse cells could be isolated from\nlipoaspirates using severe cellular stress, such as long-term exposure to collagenase [44].\nWe also con\ufb01rmed that exposure to proteolysis produced the best results among our stress\nconditions, increasing the proportion of SSEA-3(+) hASCs by 3.3-fold (4.2%) compared\nto monolayer cultures (1.3%). During preliminary studies (unpublished data) to enhance\nthe ratio of SSEA-3(+) hASCs (known to be stress-tolerant [19,32]), stress magnitude was\ncarefully optimized in each experiment. However, because 37.6% of viable cells were lost,\nthe \ufb01nal number of proteolytic solution-treated SSEA-3(+) hASCs was only 1.3-fold more\n(1.7 \u00d7 103) compared to the controls (1.3 \u00d7 103), with no statistically signi\ufb01cant difference.\nThese results suggest that exposure to severe stress can concentrate SSEA-3(+) hASCs\nthrough the selective depletion of SSEA-3(\u2212) cells, but such stress can also inhibit cell\nproliferation. Instead of concentration, microsphere cultures under microgravity condi-\ntions increased SSEA-3(+) hASCs by proliferation (Figure 9). In other words, the present\nmicrogravity culture conditions increased not only the proportion, but also the number,\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n15 of 18\nof SSEA-3(+) cells to actualize regenerative therapies requiring these highly therapeutic\ncells. However, a limitation of this study is that we only assessed SSEA-3 as a pluripotent\nmarker in stress-exposure experiments. Additional research including analyses of the other\npluripotent markers (e.g., Oct4 and Sox2) may further emphasize the differences between\nmicrogravity cultures and stress-exposure cultures, or reveal new characteristics of the\ntwo cultures.\nFigure 9. Schematic representation of the study. Human adipose-derived stem cells are normally capable of heterogeneous\npotency. Exposure to stress can selectively deplete regular stem cells, but does not increase the number of highly functional\nstem cells. In contrast, microgravity/microsphere cultures can selectively cause the proliferation of highly functional cell\nsubpopulations to reach the numbers required for regenerative therapies.\nFurthermore, hASCs harvested from microgravity\u2013microsphere cultures had higher\nexpression levels of the pluripotent markers OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, KLF, and CD34\ncompared to hASCs cultured in monolayers. OCT4 and NANOG are known to be involved\nin the self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells, while SOX2, MYC, and KLF expression\nact as transcription factors to control genes involved during embryonic development [19].\nCD34 has been reported to contribute to the proliferative ability of hASCs both by us [23,45]\nand by others [46,47]. However, the upregulation of nuclear stem-cell markers was hardly\ndetected in hASCs from static microsphere cultures, suggesting that the microgravity\nenvironment may play a key role in preserving hASC functionality. In a previous report,\nspace\ufb02ight experiments demonstrated that altered gene expression was associated with\nepigenetic changes, such as chromatin re-modeling and DNA methylation [48]. The present\nresults extend these observations by demonstrating improved proliferation, angiogenesis,\nand differentiation into mesenchymal lineages (adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes)\nin hASCs from microgravity\u2013microsphere cultures compared to hASCs from cultures under\nCells 2021, 10, 560\n16 of 18\nnormal conditions. However, the fold change of the genes analyzed by RT-PCR was not so\nlarge in this study (less than 1.5), and future studies are required for further quali\ufb01cation\nof these genes through optimization of the microgravity culture protocols.\nInterestingly, the ef\ufb01cacies for collagen and polystyrene microspheres to select for\nproliferation in highly functional hASCs were roughly equivalent in the present study.\nPolystyrene microbeads require a plasma coating prior to use to enable good cell attach-\nment; therefore, collagen microbeads may be the superior practical choice for regenerative\ntherapy applications. In addition, as a biodegradable biomaterial, collagen has the ad-\nvantage that such beads may be clinically administered into a target organ together with\nhASCs; it may even augment hASC survival and functionality after transplantation by\nacting as a biological cell scaffold [1,42].\n5. Conclusions\nWe cultured hASCs with microspheres using three-dimensional movement to create\nmicrogravity conditions for the preservation of stemness, while at the same time preserving\ncell\u2013microsphere adhesion to maximize cell quantities. This new cell-culturing technique\nselectively enhanced the proliferation of highly functional stem cells, demonstrating supe-\nrior stemness, proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenic abilities, which may provide for\nenhanced treatments for intractable human diseases compared to current hASC treatments.\nHowever, further studies are required to optimize a culture protocol to maximize the\nselective expansion ef\ufb01ciency and to investigate the therapeutic value of these cells using\nin vivo experiments before clinical trials can proceed.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/2073-440\n9/10/3/560/s1, Video S1: Microgravity culture with microspheres under dynamic conditions.

The\nproject was independently conducted by NASA\nAmes Research Center Space Biosciences and\nEngineering Systems Divisions. The NASA ISS\ntissue RNA samples was successfully conducted in about 3 h, with data transmitted within 2\nh of experiment completion. Thermal cycling in microgravity resulted in the trapping of gas\nbubbles inside septa cap assay tubes, causing small but measurable increases in Ct curve\nnoise and variability. Bubble formation was successfully suppressed in a rapid follow-up on-\norbit experiment using standard caps to pressurize PCR tubes and reduce gas release dur-\ning heating cycles. The WetLab-2 facility now provides a novel operational on-orbit research\ncapability for molecular biology and demonstrates the feasibility of more complex wet bench\nexperiments in the ISS National Lab environment.\nIntroduction\nThe ISS National Laboratory is a unique research environment whereby scientists from Acade-\nmia, Government, and Industry seek to learn the effects of space on life and matter in their\nmany forms. Although a great deal has already been learned about the effects of microgravity\non biological systems, [1\u20133] the large majority of on-orbit experiments do not yield scientific\ndata until long after return of samples to Earth for analysis, creating concerns about timeliness\nof data availability, and quality of sample preservation [4]. Ground analysis of on-orbit experi-\nments has been necessary because of limited laboratory space, equipment, supplies, and astro-\nnaut time resources on ISS, but while this sample return approach maximizes efficient access\nto space by scientists, it fails to teach us how to conduct end-to-end scientific inquiries in\nmicrogravity. As human exploration of the solar system proceeds, human missions to Mars\nand deep space will require greater levels of autonomy and resourcefulness as outlined in the\nNational Research Council\u2019s Space Exploration Decadal Survey for Life and Physical Sciences\n[5] An important component of future traveling and living in space away from low Earth orbit\nwill be the ability to perform modern molecular biology analyses, including purifying RNA\nand conducting Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) or other genomic analy-\nses for disease diagnostics including viral and bacterial infection, environmental microorgan-\nism identification and monitoring of food and water, and in any other research application\nwhere monitoring gene expression is required.\nAlthough there are increasing numbers of studies of gene expression in microgravity, there\nare no reports of any methodologies for RNA purification and RT-qPCR under microgravity\nconditions, effectively preventing on-orbit analysis of gene expression or PCR-based diagnos-\ntics from biological samples. Specifically, recent RNA isolation and PCR-based gene expres-\nsion studies of biological samples on ISS, Space Shuttle and Biosatellites have been conducted\non earth after preserved sample return from space [6\u201314]. Recent efforts by various groups of\ninvestigators have sought to develop portions of an overall genomic and molecular biology\nexperimental capability on ISS. Specifically, these include the NASA Genes in Space 1,\nminiPCR student experiment, [15] and the \u201cBiomolecular Sequencer\u201d Nanopore DNA\nsequencing demonstration [16, 17] both conducted simultaneously with WetLab-2. Both\nexperiments however, started with genomic DNA samples, not indicative of gene expression,\nand relied either on sample return to earth for PCR product analysis, (miniPCR), or complex\nsequencing library preparation on earth prior to nanopore sequencing in space (Biomolecular\nSequencer). Neither of these experiments had the end-to-end on-orbit capability to extract\nRNA from tissue, convert mRNA to cDNA for RT-qPCR, or to generate quantitative gene\nexpression data as we sought to achieve with the WetLab-2 system.\nNovel system for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis in microgravity\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183480\nSeptember 6, 2017\n2 / 20\nfunders had no role in study design, data collection\nand analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of\nthe manuscript.\nCompeting interests: NASA provided both the\nfunding and employs the majority of the authors\nthat conducted this study, which may be perceived\nas a competing interest, however, the funding\norganization within NASA (ISS Program at\nJonhson Space Center) is distinct from the\nperforming organizations (Space Biosciences and\nEngineering Systems Divisions at NASA Ames\nResearch Center), and the project leadership\nincluding the corresponding author (EACA) and\nproject Managers (CSR and JS) are protected from\nfunder influence by academic tenure-like civil\nservice positions. In addition MB and RD are\nemployed by Claremont Biosolutions and may\nbenefit in their employment from the publication of\ntheir contributions.\nTo address the pressing ISS research and diagnostics need for novel on-orbit end-to-end\nmolecular biology gene expression analysis methods and tools, we devised a robust micrograv-\nity fluidic system that can intake diverse biological sample (cells, tissue, surface swabs, blood,\netc.) and using temperature-stable reagents, allow for the isolation and purification of nucleic\nacids, such as RNA, for molecular biology analysis. In addition, the system includes a micro-\ngravity compatible thermal cycler, lyophilized reagents and enzymes for PCR assays and meth-\nods for reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA, and capabilities for heat inactivation of\nenzymes such as proteinase K and PCR inhibitors, plus RT-qPCR gene expression analysis\nusing fluorescent TaqMan probes. The WetLab2 suite of instruments and reagents we describe\nhere is novel and unique methodology, substantially distinct from all other existing RNA isola-\ntion and RT-qPCR gene expression analysis systems, because of its ability to function in micro-\ngravity, with altered fluid flow, hydrostatic pressure, convection, and surface tension\nconditions of space, while still providing full reagent containment for safe operation on ISS.\nUsing this system, schematically shown in Fig 1, generic reagents and supplies can be preposi-\ntioned on ISS to flexibly support science opportunities such as optimizing plant growth, moni-\ntoring the evolution of bacterial communities in biofilms, or analyzing gene expression in\nimmune cells from blood, among many other applications. In addition, the WetLab-2 system\nwas also designed to be capable of purifying RNAs for return to Earth, or for other on-orbit\nmolecular biology analyses such as nanopore array-based mRNA sequencing studies, greatly\nincreasing the analysis capabilities of the system and possibilities for discovery in space.\nIn its validation flight, WetLab-2 successfully demonstrated its capabilities to conduct\nmolecular biology experimentation in microgravity. This consisted of first demonstrating that\nqPCR functions in microgravity conditions, followed by demonstration of RNA isolation from\nbacterial cell and mammalian tissue and gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR. When gases\nevolved by thermal cycling accumulated in PCR tubes due to microgravity conditions inter-\nfered with data uniformity, the system demonstrated its flexibility and adaptability to on-orbit\nexperiment modification and iteration in real-time. WetLab-2 also used volunteer astronaut\ntime and spare supplies to design and execute follow-up experiments while on-orbit to resolve\nthe gas bubble problem. Below we describe in detail the design and scientific validation of the\nWetLab-2 suite of methods, reagents, and hardware for RNA purification and gene expression\nanalysis by RT-qPCR, enabling future molecular biology experimentation to be conducted\nend-to-end in real-time on ISS, and allowing data interpretation and experiment redesign\nwhile on-orbit.\nMaterials and methods\nIn order to validate the system, a number of ground-based and on-orbit tests were performed\nincluding: validation of E. coli primer assays (ground), validation of lyophilized components\n(ground), validation of the SPM (ground), validation of all hardware (ground), validation of\nqPCR efficiency using pre-prepared assays (on-orbit), validation of RNA extracted from E. coli\n(on-orbit), and from mouse liver tissue (on-orbit) using the SPM. The methods used in these\nvalidation experiments are described in detail below.\nPrimer and probe design\nThis study used three types of assays for different portions of the validation of the system.\nFirst, an E. coli genomic assay was used to demonstrate if qPCR was possible in microgravity\nand that the data matched 1 g controls. This was followed with a set of E. coli gene expression\nassays designed to validate the sample prep and RT-qPCR capabilities of the system. Finally, a\nset of mouse gene expression assays were used to validate the system with a mammalian tissue.\nNovel system for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis in microgravity\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183480\nSeptember 6, 2017\n3 / 20\nThe E. coli primers and probes used in this study were designed in-house to target both\ngenomic and exonic regions. The E. coli genomic assay consisted of primers targeting the 16S\nribosomal DNA sequence for rrnH gene while the gene expression assays targeted the follow-\ning genes: heat shock protein 70\u20132 (dnaK), RNA polymerase (rpoA), and a glucitol operon\nFig 1. Operations for the WetLab-2 system. Isolation and purification of RNA from biological tissues on\u2013orbit starts with introduction of\ncells or tissues for lysis and homogenization into the Sample Preparation Module (SPM), followed by RNA binding to an affinity column,\nwashing, and elution from the module. A Pipette Loader (PL) tool is provided for bubble free fluid transfer to a repeater pipette. This is then\nused to dispense accurate volumes of purified RNA into a centrifuge rotor/rack of lyophilized reagent tubes with enzymes and regents for\nreverse transcription and Taqman RT-qPCR. Data is available on-orbit within 3h of initiating the experiment, and transmitted by ISS to NASA\nMarshall Space Flight Center for emailing to investigators within 2 h of clean-up. A more detailed description of the process can be found in\nthe S1 Text.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183480.g001\nNovel system for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis in microgravity\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183480\nSeptember 6, 2017\n4 / 20\nrepressor (srlR). For mouse assays, pre-designed intron spanning assays targeting genes for\nglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and 60S ribosomal protein L19 (rpl19)\nwere used for normalization and fibronectin 1 (fn1) was used to measure gene expression anal-\nysis. All primers and probes were produced by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville,\nIowa). In all cases, TaqMan based technology was used [18]. The corresponding fluorescent\ndye and its primer and probe sequences are shown in Table 1.\nAssay formulation, preparation, and validation\nTo validate the E. coli genomic assay formulation, we analyzed qPCR performance using vary-\ning quantities of template in tenfold dilutions between 1 \u03bcg and 1 pg (inclusive). Assays were\nconstituted using high molecular weight genomic DNA from E. coli type B cells (Affymetrix,\nSunnyvale, CA), custom primers and probe targeting a 16S ribosomal DNA sequence (IDT,\nCoralville, Iowa), GoTaq Probe Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI), and molecular biology\ngrade water (TekNova, Hollister, CA). Amplification was achieved via a standard thermal pro-\ntocol that included a hot-start activation step (95\u02daC, 2 min) and 45 cycles of denaturation\n(95\u02daC, 15 s) and annealing/extension (54\u02daC, 60 s). Samples were run in duplicate technical rep-\nlicates and their average Ct values were plotted against template concentration to determine\nR-square and efficiency of amplification. Products were confirmed using a Bioanalyzer 2100\nand an Agilent DNA chip, using a DNA 1000 protocol and reagent.\nGenomic and gene expression assays for E. coli (dnaK, rpoA and srIR) and mouse tissue\n(gapdh, rpl19, and fn1) were validated using genomic E. coli DNA and RNA from E. coli K12\nTable 1.

Amplification was achieved via a single step\nRT-qPCR thermal protocol that includes a Reverse Transcription (45\u02daC, 15 min), hot-start\nactivation step (95\u02daC, 2 min) and 45 cycles of denaturation (95\u02daC, 15 s) and annealing/exten-\nsion (54\u02daC, 60 s), further detailed online at protocols.io [19].\nLyophilized assay validation\nAfter successful validation of assay performance, all assay formulations were purchased as\nlyophilized sample-ready products in the Reaction Tubes (BioGX, Birmingham, AL). The pro-\ntocol for lyophilized assay generation is detailed in online at protocols.io [20]. To test the per-\nformance of the lyophilized assays, Ct values of lyophilized assays were compared to those of\nnon-lyophilized controls. For the E. coli genomic assay three concentrations of template; high\n(100 ng), mid (1 ng), and low (10 pg), along with no template controls (NTC), were run for\neach group. Non-lyophilized controls were constituted as described above while lyophilized\nassays were re-hydrated with elution buffer (Claremont BioSolutions, Upland, CA). Lyophi-\nlized E. coli and mouse liver gene expression assays were tested by running singleplex, duplex,\nand triplex reactions. Individual, average, and standard deviation of Ct values were compared\nto corresponding controls, within template groups. Two individual lots were tested against a\nsingle benchtop control lot. BioGX also carried out independent validation of the lyophilized\nproducts.\nMicrogravity compatible RNA extraction procedure\nRNA isolation was performed utilizing an alcohol-free version of the RNA binding buffer and\nwashes for Claremont BioSolutions\u2019 commercially available OmniLyse1 [21, 22] and their\nRNAexpress\u2122column. The process was carried out in a SPM, an enclosed microgravity-com-\npatible hardware module designed to require only simple manual manipulations that can be\nperformed by an untrained user. The SPM contains syringes preloaded with wash and elution\nbuffers and has an input port with a Luer-Lok1 connection for the incoming Sample Transfer\nTool (STT). The procedure consists of lysing the sample with the battery powered OmniLyse1\nand binding of RNA to the RNAexpress\u2122column. This is followed by two washes of the col-\numn with Claremont BioSolutions wash buffer in preloaded syringes. The RNA is then eluted\ninto a removable syringe using the Claremont BioSolutions elution buffer.\nTo test the SPM performance, 100 million E. coli cells or 5 mg of mouse liver tissue were\nused for RNA extraction. Resulting RNA quantity and quality were assessed using a NanoDrop\n20001 (Thermofisher, Waltham, MD) and a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA),\nrespectively. The SPM-derived RNA was also used as the template in RT-qPCR reactions pre-\npared as stated above.\nHardware testing\nTo determine the compatibility of hardware components, reagents were stored in hardware\nfor long duration testing and were assessed for compatibility with downstream molecular biol-\nogy applications (e.g. qPCR, RNA Isolation, and RT-qPCR).\nNovel system for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis in microgravity\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183480\nSeptember 6, 2017\n6 / 20\nACT2s (specialty microgravity compatible transfer hardware, Techshot, Greenville, IN) and\nFinger Loop syringes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were loaded and stored at -80\u02daC. Units were\nremoved from the freezer at designated time points, allowed to thaw at ambient temperature\n(at least 1 h for the ACT2 and 45 min for the Finger Loop syringe), then RNA was extracted\nusing the SPM procedure described above. To test the SPMs for reagent compatibility, SPMs\nwere assembled with the syringes preloaded with wash and elution buffers and stored at ambi-\nent temperatures. At designated time points, SPMs were used to isolate fresh samples of either\n1x108 E. coli cells or 5 mg of mouse liver tissue. For all hardware tests, RNA quantity and qual-\nity were assessed as described previously. RT-qPCR using sample specific primers and probe\nwere also used to test RNA quality as described previously.\nReaction Tubes containing lyophilized E. coli and mouse gene expression assays, master\nmixes and enzymes were packaged at BioGX (8 tubes per sealed pouch) and stored at 4\u02daC until\ntested. All lyophilized mixes were tested at designated time points and utilized 25 ng of E. coli\nor mouse Qiagen RNeasy purified RNA (as appropriate) in 25 \u03bcl of molecular biology grade\nwater to rehydrate the assays. Amplification conditions used were described above. In all cases,\nresults were compared to those from the t = 0 time point. The thermocycler to be flown to the\nISS was also validated prior to use.\nDetails of all hardware testing results are shown in the S2 Text.\nOn-orbit quantitative PCR analyses\nMicrogravity data generated in this study were attained from on-orbit operations onboard the\nISS. All materials, hardware, and biology were transported during the SpaceX CRS-8 cargo\nresupply mission that launched to the ISS on April 8th, 2016 and experiments were conducted\non April 19th, 22nd, 26th, 29th and May 2nd. Operations required the use of the WetLab-2 hard-\nware suite consisting of microgravity-compatible STT (ACT2 or Finger Loop syringe), SPM,\nbubble-removing Pipette Loader (PL), reaction tube centrifugation rotor and a Cepheid\nSmartCycler1 for thermocycling/fluorescence readout, as described in S1 Text. 1 g control\ndata were generated using identical protocols and hardware within 12 h of completion of ISS\noperations. The on-orbit operations consisted of three types of tests. First, the efficiency of\nqPCR in microgravity using pre-prepared reaction mixtures including E. coli genomic DNA\nwas tested three times. Second, isolation of RNA on-orbit using the SPM and pre-frozen E. coli\ncells followed by analysis of gene expression was tested followed by testing of RNA isolation\nfrom mammalian tissue using the SPM and pre-frozen mouse liver tissue followed by analysis\nof gene expression.\nFor each experiment, one ISS and one ground kit were removed from their respective cold\nstowage (both 4\u02daC and -80\u02daC if applicable) and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for\n2\u20137 h. For ISS operations, experiments were performed within a RNase-free and cleaned Dis-\nposable Glove Bag (DGB) to prevent contamination. At the start of ISS operations, session\nmaterials contained in RNase-free bags were placed into the DGB and wiped with RNase\nAWAY\u2122wipes (Molecular BioProducts\u2122, Waltham, MA). The 1 g control experiment was con-\nducted in a standard molecular biology laboratory; all work surfaces were cleaned using RNase\nAWAY\u2122wipes and 70% ethanol. Data from the ISS experiments were downlinked within 2 h\nof completion of the clean-up activity and results were statistically compared with those from\ncorresponding 1 g controls. A total of five ISS runs were performed; one dataset was lost due\nto a PL hardware malfunction. All five 1 g control experiments were performed nominally.\nThe efficiency of qPCR performed in microgravity was determined using reaction mixtures\ncontaining low, mid, or high concentrations of E. coli DNA template and a no template control\n(NTC) as described above. Reagents were lyophilized in custom capped SmartCycler1 reaction\nNovel system for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis in microgravity\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183480\nSeptember 6, 2017\n7 / 20\ntubes on December 1st, 2015. Four tubes of each concentration were packaged into tube kits.\nAll tube kits and the elution buffer were transported and stored at 4\u02daC to minimize loss of\nenzyme activity and maintain quality. On-orbit operations consisted of de-bubbling the buffer\nusing the PL and loading it into a repeater pipette that was used to add 25 \u03bcl to each reaction\ntube. The tubes were centrifuged and loaded into the SmartCycler to analyze qPCR efficiency.\nRNA isolation using the SPM in microgravity was validated using 1x108 E. coli cells grown\non the ground and transferred into a STT (ACT2) and stored at -80\u02daC or colder. E. coli RNA\nisolation and RT-qPCR was performed on April 29th 2016. Tube kits for this study consisted of\nfour tubes each of singleplex assay dnaK-FAM, singleplex rpoA-HEX, duplex (dnaK-FAM and\nrpoA-HEX), and triplex (dnaK-FAM, rpoA-HEX and srlR-Cy5). All assay and RT-qPCR\nreagents were lyophilized in SmartCycler1 Reaction Tubes on Dec 1st, 2015. The tube kits\nwere transported and stored at 4\u02daC until used while other hardware and consumables were\nkept at ambient. On-orbit operations consisted of processing the bacterial culture through the\nSPM, followed by de-bubbling and tube loading as stated above. The tubes were centrifuged\nand loaded into the SmartCycler1 for gene expression analysis with RT-qPCR.\nTo test isolation of RNA from mammalian tissue in microgravity using the SPM, 5 mg of\nmouse liver tissue were biopsied on the ground and transferred into a STT (10 ml finger loop\nsyringe) with 2 ml of lysis buffer (Claremont BioSolutions, Upland, CA). Samples were flash-\nfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u02daC on March 4th, 2016. Mouse liver tissue RNA iso-\nlation and RT-qPCR was performed on May 2nd 2016. Tube kits for this study consisted of\nfour tubes each of singleplex assay gapdh-FAM, singleplex rpl19-HEX, duplex (gapdh-FAM\nand rpl19-HEX), and triplex (gapdh-FAM, rpl19-HEX and fn1-Cy5). The reagents were lyoph-\nilized and transported as described above. On-orbit operations were the same as those for the\nbacterial culture.\nA follow on experiment was performed on October 19th, 2016 during increment 49, using a\nspare E. coli kit. This experiment consisted of a repeat of the E. coli gene expression study, how-\never, at the start of operations, modified septa caps were removed from 4 technical replicates\nof the singleplex reaction (dnaK-FAM) and 4 technical replicates of the duplex reaction\n(dnaK-FAM, rpoA-HEX) tubes. After addition of the RNA, the reaction tubes were closed\nusing clipped tube caps from commercial Cepheid SmartTubes (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA).\nThe 1 g control experiment was conducted with a 24 h delay.\nAnalyses and statistics\nCepheid SmartCycler 2.0d software was used to analyze all fluorescence intensities and gener-\nate Ct values. All pre-launch ground testing used the default software values (Background Sub-\ntraction: ON, Background Min: 5, Background Max: 40, Primary Curve Analysis, Manual\nThreshold: 30, Boxcar Averaging: 0), while microgravity to 1 g comparisons used slightly mod-\nified values with a Boxcar averaging of 3. Genomic DNA qPCR runs used: Background Sub-\ntraction: ON, Background Min: 5, Background Max: 40, Primary Curve Analysis, Manual\nThreshold: 30, Boxcar Averaging: 3; software values for the E. coli RT-qPCR runs: Background\nSubtraction: ON, Background Min: 1, Background Max: 40, Primary Curve Analysis, Manual\nThresholds: (FAM: 15, HEX: 15, Cy5: 15) Boxcar Averaging: 3; and software values for the\nmouse liver RT-qPCR runs: Background Subtraction: ON, Background Min: 5, Background\nMax: 40, Primary Curve Analysis, Manual Thresholds: (FAM: 15, HEX: 30, Cy5: 15) Boxcar\nAveraging: 3; for the Increment 49 Bubble Mitigation run: Background Subtraction: ON, Back-\nground Min: 1, Background Max: 40, Primary Curve Analysis, Manual Thresholds: (FAM: 15,\nHEX: 15, Cy5: 15) Boxcar Averaging: 0. Amplification efficiency was calculated using the for-\nmula: E = (10[\u20131/slope]-1)\u0003100.\nNovel system for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis in microgravity\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183480\nSeptember 6, 2017\n8 / 20\nStatistical analyses were performed using JMP10 (SAAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and\nGraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA). Comparisons made between micro-\ngravity and 1 g control data, or between lyophilized and benchtop control assays across differ-\nent template concentrations were evaluated using ANOVA or Student\u2019s t-test as appropriate.\nIn all cases, figures report the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) and p \u0014 0.05 was considered\nthe threshold for significance. Outliers were calculated using Grubb\u2019s test with alpha = 0.05.\nResults\nqPCR in microgravity\nAssay design and testing.\nIn order to assess the functionality of PCR in microgravity con-\nditions and to establish the dynamic range and efficiency of amplification, we designed a\nrobust quality control qPCR assay to measure these parameters. We targeted a 16S ribosomal\nregion of genomic E. coli DNA. The abundant target expression improved precision, sensitiv-\nity, and reproducibility, providing robust assay conditions.\nValidation of the E. coli genomic DNA assay was performed using a standard thermal\ncycling protocol with controlled quantities of commercially available E. coli DNA as template.\nAssays were tested with template quantities between 1 pg and 1 \u03bcg, in duplicates (Fig 2A), and\nevaluated based on amplification plot characteristics and reaction efficiency. Results show that\nassays successfully generated amplification products, as detected by qPCR, with fluorescence\npeaks between 300 and 600 units. Assay efficiency was determined to be at 96.8% with an R2\ngreater than 0.99 (Fig 2A inset). Specificity and accuracy was confirmed by gel band migration\nanalysis, with the product amplicon generating bands of the expected molecular size.\nIn order to minimize crew time and the need for refrigeration resources, pre-formulated\nreagents were lyophilized in the Cepheid SmartTube detection window. To validate that the\nlyophilized assay format and lyophilization process did not compromise assay performance\n[23], we tested the lyophilized products by assessing qPCR performance in comparison to\ncommercial non-lyophilized reagents (control). This was performed using high, mid and low\ntemplate concentrations and a NTC. Combined data between two lots of lyophilized product\nshow that lyophilized assays were able to consistently generate Ct values similar to those gener-\nated by non-lyophilized controls (see Table 2).\nMicrogravity qPCR runs. Following transport to the ISS and an initial software and\ninstrument setup, the system was tested with three runs of the E. coli genomic DNA assay.\nData from the first run is shown in Fig 2B and has a typical qPCR amplification curve,\nalthough an unusual amount of noise was observed in microgravity samples especially in later\ncycles. Furthermore, when the default SmartCycler software values were used, outliers were\nobserved resulting in high standard deviations between replicate samples. These outliers did\nnot impair the clustering of the on-orbit data with the respective DNA concentrations.\nData from a second run was similar to the first but a third repeat run did not yield results\ndue to tube dispensing errors attributed to a PL malfunction. Post-run photos of the tubes\nshowed that no liquid was transferred into most of the tubes.\nNoise in the curves was attributed to degassing bubble formation in the tube detection win-\ndows during thermal cycling [24\u201326], as confirmed by post-run photos of the tubes. Photos of\nall tubes were taken before and after thermal protocol completion, the inset in Fig 2B shows\npre- and post-run photos of a representative tube for reference. The pre and post photos of the\ntubes reveal significant bubble formation and microgravity-trapping during the heating cycles\nof the qPCR reaction. The bubbles were likely caused by degassing during thermocycling [26]\nand their evolution and trapping may cause noise in fluorescence intensity detection. We used\nthe SmartCycler software boxcar averaging to smooth out the amplification curve noise, but\nNovel system for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis in microgravity\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183480\nSeptember 6, 2017\n9 / 20\nFig 2. qPCR validation in microgravity.

All statistical comparisons for this study used this\ndata.\nMicrogravity and 1 g control data comparisons.\nShortly after the completion of each of\nthe on-orbit operations, a 1 g control run was performed. Care was taken to match the removal\ntime of the lyophilized assays from 4\u02daC to the start of operations. Fig 2C\u20132F shows side-by-\nside comparisons of microgravity runs and their matched 1 g controls. Amplification curves\nfrom the corresponding 1 g control runs were smooth and similar to those obtained during\nprevious testing. Non-specific amplification, as observed from the NTC tubes (black lines),\nwere seen on both microgravity and 1 g control graphs. Given that the target gene is a 16S\nrRNA, non-specific amplification in the NTC samples may be seen when Taq polymerase is\nbacteria-derived [27] or due to primer derived artifacts. Microgravity fluorescence intensity\nvalues also show a lower overall amplitude potentially due to bubbles blocking/reducing some\nof the collected fluorescence signal [24\u201326]. Raw background fluorescence data between\nmicrogravity and 1 g control were also compared and details can be found in the S1 File.\nComparison of microgravity and 1 g control Ct values revealed that despite the noise and\nreduced intensity in microgravity samples, the Ct values still appear to be comparable to 1 g\ncontrol results as seen in Fig 2G & 2H and in S1 Table.\nEfficiency plots for the microgravity and 1 g control samples (Fig 2C\u20132F insets) were gener-\nated with Ct values using a Boxcar averaging of 3 and otherwise default software settings. The\nefficiency for the 1 g control data was 105.1% for run 1 and 102.7% for run 2 and the linear\nstandard curve R2 = 0.9971 and 0.9985 respectively and microgravity data was 104.1% and\n108.1% and R2 = 0.9620 and 0.9865 respectively. One microgravity PCR efficiency was slightly\noutside of the optimal efficiency range of 90\u2013105%, likely due to the effects of bubbles present\nin the detection window.\nRNA sample prep and RT-qPCR analysis in microgravity\nAssay design and testing.\nE. coli and mouse gene expression assays were tested and vali-\ndated using Qiagen RNeasy derived RNA. For both species, genes were tested using the same\nsingleplex, duplex, and triplex formats that were planned to be used on ISS. Table 3 shows rep-\nresentative Ct value data. All primer and probe sets yielded consistent RT-qPCR reactions\nwith resulting Ct values between 19 and 24 when 100 ng of starting RNA was used.\nLyophilized E. coli and mouse RNA gene expression assays, singleplex, duplex and triplex\nformulations, were tested as described above. All lyophilized assays generated similar PCR\nTable 2.

Table 3 shows the results from the triplex\nassays, results generated by the singleplex and duplex assays yielded similar results. ANOVA\nanalyses of these results showed no statistical variation between lyophilized assays and their\nnon-lyophilized controls, therefore indicating that lyophilized assays were suitable for use on\nISS.\nSPM design and testing.\nAn enclosed, simple RNA extraction procedure not requiring\ntoxic chemicalsthat may complicate operation on ISS, was adapted (by removing alcohol)\nfrom commercially available Claremont BioSolutions products (Fig 3A). The resulting SPM\nwas tested to ensure that the RNA yield was of sufficient quantity and quality for RT-qPCR\n[30]. Following optimization, RNA yields from the SPM were 2\u201310 \u03bcg for 1 x 108 E. coli and\n1.5\u20138 \u03bcg for 5 mg mouse liver. The RNA quality was adequate with RINs of 7.9 \u00b11.2 for E. coli\nand 7.4 \u00b11.6 for mouse liver. Fig 3B shows typical SPM extracted RNA quality at 1 g for both\nE. coli and mouse liver. Ct values from RT-qPCR runs using RNA isolated from the SPM were\nalso similar to results from Qiagen purified RNA. Residual E. coli RNA purified in micrograv-\nity was returned to Earth on SpaceX CRS-8 for Bioanalyzer testing. The RNA extracted in\nmicrogravity (RIN 8.5) was compared to that of RNA extracted at 1 g on the same day (RIN 8)\nand is of comparable quality (Fig 3B) showing that RNA was successfully purified on the ISS.\nE. coli RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analyses.\nAfter confirming that qPCR in micrograv-\nity was possible and with results comparable to 1 g controls, we proceeded to test the capability\nof the hardware system to isolate and process samples in microgravity. An E. coli sample, used\nto test the system\u2019s capabilities with prokaryotic cells, was processed and analyzed on ISS as\ndescribed previously. The RT-qPCR assays tested included singleplex (Fig 3C), duplex (Fig\n3D), and triplex (Fig 3E) reactions (S1 Table), each performed in quadruplicate to improve sta-\ntistical sampling. All microgravity and 1 g control reactions resulted in readable Ct data. In\nagreement with previous results, microgravity Ct values exhibited increased variability com-\npared to 1 g controls. Despite the greater variability observed in microgravity Ct values, no sta-\ntistically significant difference was found between the microgravity and 1 g control data. One\noutlier was identified in the microgravity data and was not used in statistical comparisons.\nAlso, one microgravity triplex tube did not give data in the FAM channel (dnaK).\nMouse RNA isolation and RT-qPCR.\nThe final study explored the system\u2019s capabilities\nto isolate RNA from a mammalian tissue, using the resulting RNA as the template in RT-\nqPCR analysis. Similar to the E. coli experiment, quadruplicates of singleplex (Fig 3F), duplex\n(Fig 3G), and triplex (Fig 3H) RT-qPCR reactions were conducted. A significant correlation\nbetween the microgravity and 1 g control data was observed, however, microgravity data\nTable 3.

These results indicate that RNA was successfully isolated from\nmouse liver tissue during spaceflight.\nSingleplex and duplex assays of the reference genes gapdh and rpl19 showed no statistical\ndifferences between microgravity and 1 g control. However, in spaceflight, no gapdh-FAM sig-\nnal was observed during triplex assays whilst 1 g control triplex assays resulted in detection of\nall three genes.\nRepeat run of E. coli RNA isolation and bubble mitigation\nFollowing the completion of on-orbit activities, an opportunity arose several months later to\ntest bubble formation mitigation strategies while repeating the E. coli isolation activity. To test\nthis, half of the modified reaction tube septa caps were replaced with standard SmartTube\ncaps. However, the age of the sample preparation reagents was past the latest longevity testing\nduration and this test resulted in compromised Ct values in the FAM and Cy5 channels. The\nHEX channel appeared to be unaffected as seen in Fig 4. A reduction in noise was observed\nwith the use of standard caps (Fig 4B) as compared to the typical noise seen when septa caps\nare used (Fig 4A). Additionally, photos taken of the tubes after completion of the RT-qPCR\nrun show an increase in the number of bubbles in the septa capped tubes as compared to those\nFig 3.

We hypothesize that the internal tube pressure created when inserting the\nstandard caps helps mitigate bubble formation. This was corroborated by sideways and\ninverted (upside down) ground thermocycling experiments that also trapped bubbles.\nDiscussion\nOne of the major obstacles to space exploration going forward in the coming decades is the\nfact that microgravity research outposts such as ISS are so closely dependent on Earth support\nof everyday activities, and lack the ability to operate autonomously. The National Academies\nof Sciences in their Decadal Survey [5] have identified some of these limitations as important\nconcerns and offered direction that the ISS should operate more like Earth-based laboratories,\nallowing for experiments to be designed, conducted, modified and iterated in space. Despite\nthe thousands of investigations already conducted on ISS [31], there are still overwhelming\nlimitations [32, 33] that prevent science and specifically molecular biology measurements of\ngene expression from being conducted and analyzed on-orbit.\nFrom its inception, the NASA WetLab-2 project has sought to address these concerns by\nintroducing new, time-efficient, practical and flexible molecular biology gene expression anal-\nysis capabilities to the ISS. The WetLab-2 hardware system can now rapidly perform RNA iso-\nlation on-orbit and use those RNAs to immediately conduct RT-qPCR analyses, or other novel\nanalyses such as nanopore-based RNA sequencing. The utility of WetLab-2 can be applied to\nmany molecular biology experimental designs using a variety of sample types and provides\ninvestigators with improved insight and interactivity during experimentation. Overall, the on-\norbit process of total RNA isolation and gene expression analysis is accomplished in a span of\napproximately 3 h without the requirement for a highly experienced user and provides a new\ncapability to ISS that will greatly expand the limits of possible on-orbit science.\nFig 4. HEX amplification curves and photos from microgravity reactions comparing different caps. (A) HEX amplification curves\nwhen our modified septa caps are used. (B) HEX amplification curves from tubes sealed with the standard commercial SmartTube Caps.\nPost run photos of representative tubes are shown above.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183480.g004\nNovel system for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis in microgravity\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183480\nSeptember 6, 2017\n14 / 20\nSuccessful development and deployment of the WetLab-2 system to the ISS depended on\nsolving a number of challenges such as limited refrigeration availability, hazardous reagent use\nallowances, power consumption, and availability of crew time. In addition, the suite of hard-\nware and fluidic components had to function in microgravity and provide ease of use for non-\nexpert operators.\nIn order to perform thermal cycling on-orbit, a suitable, commercially available thermal\ncycler that was capable of operating in a microgravity environment was identified. Specifically,\nthe Cepheid SmartCycler best met the requirements without significant modifications. The\ninstrument is modular, has reduced power requirements and offers assay wells with individual\nthermal protocol programming allowing for simultaneous running of assays with different\noptimal primer annealing temperatures. Validation testing of this instrument included physi-\ncal durability tests and validation of all 16 sample sites.\nTaqMan assays were selected because of the ability to multiplex assays with multiple color\nprobes in a single tube, and because alternatives such as SYBRGreen DNA intercalating dyes\nare carcinogenic, resulting in safety concerns for the ISS crew and imposing elevated contain-\nment requirements.\nNext we developed a RNA isolation and RT-qPCR workflow using non-hazardous reagents\nsuitable for room temperature storage. A RNA binding column and cell lysis system for RNA\npurification was selected from Claremont BioSolutions for its ease of integration [21, 22]. In\ncollaboration with Claremont, the RNA extraction protocol was modified to meet room tem-\nperature storage and low toxicity requirements. RNA extracted from the SPM proved to be of\nsufficient high quality and quantity for gene expression studies utilizing RT-qPCR (Fig 3B).\nLongevity testing of loaded SPMs showed no degradation of the reagents for at least 26 weeks\n(S2 Text).\nWe proceeded to develop a lyophilized all-in-one detection assay to minimize crew time\nand storage requirements. Lacking instruments to evaluate RNA purity and potential gDNA\ncontamination, intron-spanning primers that give a product approximately 100 bases in length\nwere used in eukaryotic samples. In prokaryotic samples, DNase enzyme [34] was included\ndue to the lack of introns in the coding region [35]. To ensure that lyophilized assays provided\nsimilar results to those obtained using wet bench chemistry, we performed extensive validation\ntesting. Our results indicate no significant differences between lyophilized and commercial\nnon-lyophilized assays (see Table 2). When refrigerated, the lyophilized assays were stable with\na shelf life of at least 52 weeks (S2 Text). To provide longer shelf life and room temperature\nstorage conditions in the future, we plan to use the standard commercial caps, as they appear\nto perform better in initial results from ongoing long-term storage tests.\nBefore the WetLab-2 system could be made available to researchers, the system was vali-\ndated to ensure that the data obtained on-orbit was not affected or biased by microgravity con-\nditions, including surface tension-dominated fluid dynamics and lack of convection [36].\nSpecifically, because PCR consists of repeated cycles of rapid heating and cooling, lack of grav-\nity-induced convection mixing in microgravity may limit heat transfer throughout the sample\nto only conduction which may require longer denaturation and annealing/extension times.\nTo validate PCR efficiency in microgravity, control qPCR reactions were conducted once\nthe system was installed on-orbit. These tests included validation with a range of pre-prepared\nDNA template concentrations (low, mid and high) to assess PCR efficiency. Three replicate\nruns were conducted, of which two were successful in returning qPCR amplification curves\nthat showed close correlation to 1 g controls. Furthermore, the microgravity Ct results were\ncomparable to their respective 1 g controls (Fig 2 and S1 Table). Although amplification was\nsuccessful, microgravity data showed increased variability within replicate sets. Analysis of the\namplification plots, post-assay tube windows, and follow up experiments suggest that this\nNovel system for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis in microgravity\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183480\nSeptember 6, 2017\n15 / 20\nincreased variability may be caused by degassing bubble formation that interferes with fluores-\ncence detection. In subsequent ground-based experiments, we found that these bubbles rise\nout of the tube detection window under normal 1 g conditions. Conversely, in microgravity,\nbubbles form, are retained and expand in the tube optical window during thermocycling, cre-\nating noise (choppiness) in the resulting amplification curves. Despite higher variability when\nusing septa caps, our data show that qPCR can be conducted in the SmartCycler using TaqMan\nassays in microgravity conditions, and that resulting Ct values are comparable to those of 1 g\ncontrols, albeit noisier (Fig 2G & 2H). These results indicate that the physical alterations of\nfluid and thermal dynamics in microgravity are not sufficient to alter enzymatic amplification\nof DNA during PCR thermal cycling in the SmartCycler.\nTo validate that the WetLab-2 system could successfully isolate RNA from intact cells and\ntissue, as well as perform RT-qPCR analyses on-orbit, we prepared and froze samples of E. coli\nand mouse liver tissue on the ground. Results show that RNA was successfully isolated on-\norbit using the SPM and that singleplex and multiplex RT-qPCR analyses from both E. coli\ncells and mouse liver tissues resulted in successful qPCR amplification (Fig 3 and S1 Table).\nSuccessful multiplex RT-qPCR allows for the use of ratiometric methods; expression of genes\nof interest can be measured relative to reference genes in the same tube, thereby effectively\nnormalizing variability that may exist in RNA concentrations or other artifacts of microgravity\nPCR amplification.\nComparison of raw background fluorescence data showed significant differences between\nmicrogravity and 1 g control samples (S1 File), however, no significant differences in Ct values.\nIn agreement with genomic DNA standards data, increased variability was also observed in the\nmicrogravity samples using SPM-derived E. coli and mouse RNA, likely due to bubble forma-\ntion during thermal cycling.\nAs this variability in Ct values may limit the utility of the system for researchers, a follow up\n\u201cvolunteer science\u201d experiment was conducted by astronaut Kate Rubins. This test was aimed\nat reducing or eliminating bubbles formed during thermal cycling and showed that the positive\npressure formed in the tubes when closed using a standard cap drastically reduces bubbles and\nresults in smooth amplification curves similar to those typically seen during RT-qPCR runs in\n1 g (Fig 4). This run yielded data with less variability; standard deviations up to 0.659 Ct for\nstandard caps compared to 1.035 Ct for septa caps. Therefore, for future experiments, we\nintend to use standard commercial tubes to suppress degassing bubble formation.\nThrough these experiments, we have demonstrated that qPCR can be successfully per-\nformed in the microgravity environment of space and developed an system of molecular biol-\nogy tools and reagents for extracting and quantitatively analyzing RNA from biological\nsamples on-orbit and generating RT-qPCR Ct data (See photos of actual on-orbit operations\nin Fig 5).\nIn conclusion, the WetLab-2 ISS system is now validated and ready for future end-to-end\ngene expression analysis on-orbit, providing prompt results and data reporting from multiple\ncell and tissue biological samples. This new capability allows investigators unprecedented flexi-\nbility with ISS research and the opportunity to re-design and iterate experiments based on data\nreceived in almost real-time. The WetLab2 system is publicly available to investigators for\nresearch on ISS [37] and can also potentially be used to analyze environmental samples, for\nmedical diagnostics, or to provide purified RNA and cDNAs for expressome sequencing and\nglobal gene expression analysis using nanopore sequencing [17] as our group recently demon-\nstrated [38]. Overall the novel molecular biology capabilities we describe here for for ISS,\nalthough trivial on earth, are an important step forward in the quest for making possible the\nexploration and development of space for human use.\nNovel system for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis in microgravity\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183480\nSeptember 6, 2017\n16 / 20\nSupporting information\nS1 Text.

Cardiac deconditioning and atrophy on Earth are\nassociated with altered Trp53 and oxidative stress-related pathways, but the effects of space\ufb02ight on\ncardiac changes at the molecular level are less understood. We tested the hypothesis that space\ufb02ight\nalters the expression of key genes related to stress response pathways, which may contribute to\ncardiovascular deconditioning during extended space\ufb02ight. Mice were exposed to space\ufb02ight for\n15 days or maintained on Earth (ground control). Ventricle tissue was harvested starting ~3 h\npost-landing. We measured expression of select genes implicated in oxidative stress pathways and\nTrp53 signaling by quantitative PCR. Cardiac expression levels of 37 of 168 genes tested were altered\nafter space\ufb02ight. Space\ufb02ight downregulated transcription factor, Nfe2l2 (Nrf2), upregulated Nox1\nand downregulated Ptgs2, suggesting a persistent increase in oxidative stress-related target genes.\nSpace\ufb02ight also substantially upregulated Cdkn1a (p21) and cell cycle/apoptosis-related gene Myc,\nand downregulated the in\ufb02ammatory response gene Tnf. There were no changes in apoptosis-related\ngenes such as Trp53. Space\ufb02ight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance, cell cycle\nand senescence in cardiac tissue of mice. Thus, space\ufb02ight may contribute to cardiac dysfunction\ndue to oxidative stress.\nKeywords: space\ufb02ight; microgravity; heart; gene expression; oxidative stress; Nfe2l2; NADPH\noxidase; Ptgs2; Cdkn1a; Myc\n1. Introduction\nResponses to space\ufb02ight include cardiovascular de\ufb01cits, loss of bone and muscle mass,\ncompromised immune function, chromosomal aberrations and metabolic changes [1\u20133].\nWith future lunar and interplanetary space missions, astronauts will stay in space for\nlonger periods, presenting increased cardiovascular risk to the crew. Therefore, a better\nunderstanding of molecular mechanisms that mediate physiological responses to the space\nenvironment is needed.\nEntering into microgravity causes a cephalad shift of body \ufb02uids which leads to\nincreased heart stroke volume, a rise in left ventricular end diastolic dimensions and a \ufb02uid\nshift between the vasculature and interstitium [4\u20136]. The \ufb02uid shift invokes compensatory\nendocrine and renal mechanisms [6]. These alterations can diminish the capability of the\nheart to cope with gravitational stress immediately after returning to Earth, leading to\northostatic intolerance, as previously documented in some astronauts [7].\nGravitational unloading in space also contributes to cardiovascular deconditioning [8],\ndespite vigorous on-orbit exercise programs implemented on the International Space\nStation (ISS). Both space\ufb02ight and head-down-tilt bed rest, a ground-based model for\nhuman space\ufb02ight, can cause reduced plasma volume and left ventricular atrophy [9,10].\nA reduction in myocardial interstitial \ufb02uid may contribute to lower myocardial mass\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22169088\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n2 of 16\nfollowing microgravity exposure [11]. In rodents, 14 days of space\ufb02ight was reported to\nreduce cardiac myocyte size relative to ground controls, which is consistent with cardiac\natrophy [12]. In contrast, space\ufb02ight for one week did not affect cardiac mass [13], although\nit is possible that this period is too short to cause demonstrable cardiac atrophy. Hindlimb\nunloading (HU), a ground-based rodent model for simulating weightlessness, is reported\nto cause cardiac atrophy in some studies [14,15], but not in others [13], thus further work\nin this area is needed.\nIn addition to gravitational unloading, long term habitation in space will expose\nastronauts to low doses of ionizing radiation, which may contribute to both cardiac and\nvascular changes in oxidative pathways leading to tissue dysfunction [16\u201318]. In fact,\nspace\ufb02ight can cause substantial changes in expression of genes and biomarkers related\nto metabolic and oxidative stress pathways in various tissues of both astronauts and\nanimals [19\u201327]. The relative contributions of the various complex factors of habitation in\nspace, including microgravity and ionizing radiation, to observed changes in oxidative\nstress-related pathways are not yet understood.\nActivation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis signal transduction pathways are major\nstress responses important for defending against many physiological and environmental\nchallenges, including tissue oxidative stress. Space\ufb02ight can alter expression of various cell\ncycle arrest and apoptosis regulatory genes [28,29] including CDKN1A (also known as P21),\na cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that mediates cell cycle arrest via cyclin interactions\nand apoptosis via TRP53. In addition, CDKN1A/P21 is a negative regulator of tissue\nregeneration in mammals, and is known to interact with NFE2L2 (aka NRF2), a master\ntranscriptional regulator of oxidative defense genes. Space\ufb02ight elevates Cdkn1a expression\nin bone tissue [30], liver and kidney [31] as well as cultured cells [29], implicating activation\nof CDKN1A as a pathway invoked in multiple tissues in response to the space environment.\nWe hypothesized that space\ufb02ight leads to activation of oxidative stress and cell\ncycle/apoptosis-related pathways in the heart. To begin to test this hypothesis, we used the-\nmatic PCR arrays to identify the changes in expression levels of genes related to oxidative\nstress and cell cycle/apoptosis (Trp53) signal transduction pathways in mice exposed to\n15 days of space\ufb02ight on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Our gene expression \ufb01ndings\nin heart are novel and consistent with activation of several molecular pathways, including\nthose related to oxidative stress, cell cycle regulation, in\ufb02ammation and DNA damage\nrepair, which ultimately may contribute to cardiac dysfunction during long duration\nspace\ufb02ight.\n2. Results\n2.1. Body Mass of Animals Pre- and Post-Flight\nImmediately after landing, all \ufb02ight (FLT) and ground (GRD) control mice were deter-\nmined to be in good condition by veterinary examination. Figure 1 shows the schematic\nof the experiment design and work\ufb02ow. The average weight loss of FLT mice over the\nduration of the experiment was 2.0 g (\u22129.1%, SD = 2.1 g, p = 0.013) whereas GRD control\nmice lost an average of 0.7 g (\u22123.4%, SD = 0.9 g, p = 0.096); the difference in body weight\nloss averages for FLT versus GRD was not signi\ufb01cant (p = 0.143). FLT habitats showed\nan average of 10% less food remaining, and 24% less water remaining than GRD habitats.\nHowever, measured values for food and water utilization after \ufb02ight may not precisely\nre\ufb02ect actual consumption by mice due to possible differences in food breakdown and\nwater spillage in FLT versus GRD habitats.\n2.2. Space\ufb02ight Altered Expression of Oxidative Stress Related Genes\nComparable quantities (average of 38.5 \u00b5g RNA per tissue sample) and high qualities\nof total RNA were obtained from all the FLT and GRD samples. To determine if space\ufb02ight\naltered the expression of genes regulating redox balance in cardiac tissue, oxidative stress\nPCR array was performed on 84 genes related to oxidative metabolism (Supplementary\nTable S1), and this data set was supplemented with real time PCR analysis of Nfe2l2\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n3 of 16\nexpression levels (Figure 2). Gene expression levels of FLT and GRD controls showed a\ntrend towards upregulation of a majority of those genes which were altered by space\ufb02ight\n(Table 1). Out of the 84 genes on the array, 11 genes were upregulated and 3 genes were\ndownregulated in FLT samples relative to GRD (p < 0.05) (Table 1).\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of experiment design and work\ufb02ow.\nTable 1. Space\ufb02ight altered the expression of genes involved in oxidative stress pathway. Expression\nlevels are represented as fold regulation in space\ufb02ight versus ground controls (FLT versus GRD).\nShown are 14 differentially regulated genes out of a panel of 84 genes related to the oxidative stress\nresponse as measured by RT-PCR. Of these, 11 were upregulated while three were downregulated.\nThe change in expression levels of these genes were found to be statistically signi\ufb01cant by Mann\u2013\nWhitney U test at p < 0.05, n = 4.\nGene Symbol\nGene Name\nFold Regulation\nNox1\nNADPH oxidase 1\n6.62\nTpo\nThyroid peroxidase\n2.35\nSlc41a3\nSolute carrier family 41, member 3\n1.97\nTxnip\nThioredoxin interacting protein\n1.94\nPrnp\nPrion protein\n1.44\nTxnrd3\nThioredoxin reductase 3\n1.43\nGsr\nGlutathione reductase\n1.31\nPrdx6\nPeroxiredoxin 6\n1.23\nCat\nCatalase\n1.20\nXpa\nXeroderma pigmentosum,\ncomplementation group A\n1.18\nSod1\nSuperoxide dismutase 1, soluble\n1.18\nNcf2\nNeutrophil cytosolic factor 2\n\u22121.49\nFancc\nFanconi anemia, complementation\ngroup C\n\u22121.62\nPtgs2\nProstaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2\n\u22123.44\nSpeci\ufb01cally, there was a marked 6.6-fold upregulation in expression of NADPH ox-\nidase 1 (Nox1), suggesting an increase in production of superoxide and/or hydrogen\nperoxide. Additionally, expression of Prostaglandin endoperoxidase synthase 2 (Ptgs2),\nwhich acts as peroxidase, was downregulated by 3.4-fold. The upregulation of Nox1 and\ndownregulation of Ptgs2 may re\ufb02ect elevated oxidative stress within heart tissue of FLT\nmice relative to GRD controls. In addition, Txnip was upregulated by 1.9-fold and Fancc\nwas downregulated 1.6-fold in FLT samples. Ncf2, which codes for a component of the\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n4 of 16\nNADPH oxidase complex that generates superoxide, was moderately downregulated by\nspace\ufb02ight (\u22121.5-fold). Other antioxidant genes (Sod1, Cat, Prdx6, Gsr, Tpo, Txnrd3, Slc41a3)\nand oxidative stress-responsive genes (Xpa, Prnp) were moderately affected by space\ufb02ight\n(1.2-2.4 fold, p < 0.05) (Table 1). There were no changes in the expression levels of 12 genes\nrelated to oxygen transport (Supplementary Table S1). In contrast, there was a 2.4-fold\nreduction in expression of the global transcription factor, Nfe2l2, in FLT compared to GRD\nanimals (Figure 2). Thus, the expression of redox-related genes was differentially regulated\nas a consequence of exposure to the space\ufb02ight environment.\nFigure 2.

The log2 (linear) normalized\nexpression from the Ground Control and Flight groups were used in the Mann\u2013Whitney U test.\n2.3. Space\ufb02ight Altered Expression of Cell Cycle/Proliferation Related Genes\nThe expression levels of 84 genes involved cell cycle and apoptosis signal transduction\nwere analyzed by p53 Signaling Pathway PCR array (Supplementary Table S2). Out of\n84 genes, 13 genes were upregulated and 10 genes were downregulated in FLT compared\nto GRD controls (Table 2, p < 0.05). Results show that genes related to cell cycle regulation\nwere altered due to space\ufb02ight. Speci\ufb01cally, cell cycle inhibitors such as Cdkn1a were up-\nregulated 6.8-fold while Cdk1 was downregulated 4.1-fold, suggesting diminished growth\nand proliferation signals in FLT samples compared to GRD. Myc was upregulated 3.9-fold\n(p < 0.05). Genes involved in in\ufb02ammatory responses, including Tnf, Tnfrsf10b (Tnf receptor\nsuperfamily, member 10) and Traf1, were downregulated (9.9-, 1.9- and 2.3-fold decrease,\nrespectively) in space\ufb02ight samples. Out of the 14 genes analyzed for DNA damage repair,\nfour genes were modestly upregulated (Atr, Xrcc5, Ercc1, Apex1; 1.1\u20131.3-fold) (Table 2,\np < 0.05). There were no signi\ufb01cant changes in apoptosis-related genes including Trp53,\nBax, Bcl2, Casp2 or Casp9 (Supplementary Table S2).\n2.4. Gene Networks and Disease Predictions\nWe made use of a computational approach to gain insight into possible protein\u2013protein\ninteractions among the differentially expressed genes. Analysis using String Db revealed\npotential interactions between the oxidative stress response and Trp53 pathways (Figure 3).\nA number of oxidative stress response DEGs formed a molecular interaction network\nincluding Nox1 and Sod1 with Catalase serving as a central node. DEGs from the Trp53\nsignaling pathway also formed molecular interaction networks involving cell cycle-related\ngenes and transcription factors. For the Trp53 pathway, Cdk1, Cdk4, Cdkn1a and Atr served\nas central nodes in a molecular network that included Chek2, Fancc, Ercc1, Xrcc5 and Xpa1\namong others. Interestingly, the oxidative stress response and Trp53 pathways were linked\nby central nodes FoxO3, Jun, Myc, and Hif1a, all of which code for major transcriptional\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n5 of 16\nregulators. This \ufb01nding suggests global transcriptomic changes in the heart response to\nspace\ufb02ight.\nTable 2.

Ex-\npression levels are represented as fold regulation in space\ufb02ight versus ground controls (FLT versus\nGRD).

Discussion\nOur \ufb01ndings provide new insight into how the heart responds at the molecular level\nto the novel environment of space. Space\ufb02ight experiments using rodents present unique\npractical challenges though similar bene\ufb01ts to rodent studies on Earth. The animals \ufb02own\nin space during this particular mission were deemed healthy, as assessed by veterinary ex-\namination after return to Earth, and the \ufb01nding that animal body weights were comparable\nin FLT mice compared to GRD controls at the termination of the study. Further, numerous\nscienti\ufb01c reports from these mice describe related results obtained studying other organ\nsystems (e.g., [30,32,33]). The RNA samples recovered from the hearts were consistent and\nof high quality. Therefore, we conclude that the results we obtained from this mission\nwere valid.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n7 of 16\nWhereas cardiovascular physiology has been studied intensively in astronauts, analysis of\ncardiac changes at the tissue level has been more limited [12,13,34\u201336]. Goldstein et al. [12] re-\nport that space\ufb02ight (14 days) reduces the cross-sectional area of papillary cardiomyocytes\nin rats relative to ground controls, with ultrastructural changes consistent with cardiac\natrophy. Short duration (6 days) space\ufb02ight upregulates activity and mRNA expression of\nthe mitochondrial enzyme, malate dehydrogenase in rat hearts, and displays a pattern of\nmitochondrial gene expression changes discrete from those in skeletal muscle [34]. More\nrecently, long duration space\ufb02ight (37 days) was shown to alter expression of methylation-\nrelated genes in the heart of adult mice, but not cytoskeletal protein levels. Interestingly,\nlifetime exposure of Drosophila to microgravity leads to diminished cardiac size, cardiac dys-\nfunction, altered remodeling, and proteosomal abnormalities [36]. Furthermore, space\ufb02ight\ncauses cardiac progenitor cells in culture to display a gene expression pro\ufb01le consistent\nwith early, stem-like function along with increased oxidative stress and re-entry into the\ncell cycle [37]. Thus, our study on expression levels of oxidative stress and cell cycle-related\ngenes provides novel \ufb01ndings on how the heart responds to space\ufb02ight at the tissue level.\n3.1. Oxidative Stress-Related Gene Expression in Space\ufb02ight Heart\nRT-PCR array data show that expression levels of 14 genes were signi\ufb01cantly (p < 0.05)\naltered (11 upregulated and 3 downregulated) in FLT samples as compared to GRD controls.\nIn addition, RT-PCR analysis for Nfe2l2 revealed lower levels in FLT mice than GRD. Nfe2l2\nis a master transcriptional regulator for oxidative stress response genes, and is rapidly\ntranscribed within seconds following changes in the gravity vector [23]. Other tissues\nalso display reduced Nfe2l2 expression levels in similar space\ufb02ight experiments entailing\ntissue recovery after landing [38]. Suzuki et al. recently demonstrated that long duration\nspace\ufb02ight activates Nfe2l2-dependent oxidative stress pathways in several tissues of\ngrowing mice [39]. Furthermore, Nfe2l2-de\ufb01cient mice are protected from space\ufb02ight-\ninduced oxidative stress-related genes and changes in body weight [39], and also display\naccelerated transition of muscle \ufb01ber type without protecting from atrophy [40].\nWe also found that space\ufb02ight upregulated Nox1 6.6-fold, the change of greatest\nmagnitude in oxidative stress-related genes observed in our study. NOX1 belongs to\nthe NADPH oxidase family of enzymes and functions in generating ROS in a highly\nregulated fashion [41,42]. NOX1 utilizes NADPH as an electron donor and catalyzes\ntransfer of electrons to molecular oxygen to generate superoxide radicals. Superoxide\nradicals are short lived and are readily converted into hydrogen peroxide. Thus, increased\nexpression of Nox1 can cause an increase in the formation of hydrogen peroxide and other\nreactive oxygen species (ROS) [41,42]. NADPH oxidases are major sources of ROS in\nthe vascular system and are involved in the pathophysiology of many cardiovascular\ndiseases such as hypertension and myocardial infarction [43]. Several recent studies\nusing ground-based models to simulate weightlessness show that hindlimb unloading\ncauses cardiac atrophy, reduces cardiomyocyte size and cardiac dysfunction, as assessed by\nfractional shortening [14]. Inhibition of NOX1 by apocynin (a NADPH oxidase inhibitor)\nreduces oxidative stress markers in the heart, and mitigates atrophy and dysfunction in\nhindlimb unloaded mice, suggesting that Nox1 plays an important role in mediating cardiac\nresponses to simulated weightlessness [44]. Thus, our results support the hypothesis\nthat increased expression of Nox1 during space\ufb02ight contributes to oxidative stress and\nmyocardial abnormalities.\nOxidative stress PCR array results showed lower expression of Ptgs2 by 3.4-fold in\nFLT samples compared to GRD. PTGS2, also known as Cycloxygenase 2 (COX2), is the\nkey, inducible enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis, and acts as both a dioxygenase and\nas a peroxidase, converting hydrogen peroxide into water. Thus, lower Ptgs2 expression\ncan lead to inef\ufb01cient removal of hydrogen peroxide, accumulation of ROS and oxidative\ndamage. PTGS2 is important for the maintenance of healthy cardiac tissue. Conditional\ncardiomyocyte-speci\ufb01c deletion of the Ptgs2 gene in adult mice reduces cardiac output,\ndecreases exercise tolerance and increases susceptibility to induced ventricular arrhyth-\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n8 of 16\nmias [45]. Furthermore, human and animal models of myocardial diseases show that\nPtgs2 expression is associated with cardiac tissue damaged by infarction, septicemia and\nin\ufb02ammatory heart diseases [46]. In addition to in\ufb02ammation, the prostaglandin pathway\nplays an important role in mechanical signaling. In cultured cells activated by serum, space-\n\ufb02ight prevents induction of Ptgs2 expression, which is avoided by on-orbit centrifugation\nto replace the gravity vector, implicating sensitivity to a biomechanical mechanism for\nmicrogravity-induced activation of the prostaglandin pathway [47]. Inhibition of PTGS2\nalso impairs recovery of skeletal muscle and bone from hindlimb unloading [48,49]. Thus,\nregulation of the prostaglandin pathway by space\ufb02ight via changes in Ptgs2 expression\nmay contribute to both oxidative stress and subsequent recovery on Earth.\nTxnip was upregulated 1.9-fold and Fancc was downregulated 1.6-fold in FLT com-\npared to GRD, which also may contribute to a pro-oxidative milieu in the heart during\nspace\ufb02ight. TXNIP is a negative regulator of thioredoxins (TRXs) [50], which are potent\nantioxidants, and their downregulation by elevated Txnip expression in FLT samples may\nlead to increased oxidative stress in cardiac tissue. In cultured human endothelial cells\n(HUVEC), Txnip was the most upregulated by space\ufb02ight (33-fold) [51]. Fancc codes for\nan antioxidant and its downregulation can cause sensitivity to oxidative stress-mediated\ndamage to tissue [52].\nOur results indicated moderate changes in several antioxidant genes (Sod1, Cat, Prdx6,\nGsr, Tpo, Txnrd3, Slc41a3) and other oxidative stress-responsive genes (Xpa, Prnp) (1.2\u20132.4-fold,\np < 0.05) (Table 1). The observed elevated expression levels of these antioxidant genes may\nbe due to activation of compensatory mechanisms.\nAlthough the magnitude of differences between FLT and GRD for statistically signi\ufb01-\ncant genes were generally modest, together, the \ufb01ndings suggest that space\ufb02ight activates\na network of genes responsible for redox signaling and defense against oxidative stress in\nthe heart.\n3.2. Cell Cycle and Senescence-Related Gene Expression in Space\ufb02ight Heart\nIncreased generation of ROS during space\ufb02ight can lead to protein, lipid and DNA\ndamage in tissue and, as is the case with skeletal muscle, may contribute to dysfunction\ncaused by gravitational unloading. ROS are also involved in vital cell signaling pathways\nsuch as cell-cycle progression, differentiation, in\ufb02ammation and apoptosis. Cell cycle\nprogression in eukaryotes is regulated at various checkpoints by the action of speci\ufb01c cyclin\ndependent kinases (CDKs). The activities of these CDKs are controlled by the positive\nregulation from cyclins and negative regulation from cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors\n(CDKIs). Hence, expression levels of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, in\ufb02ammation,\nDNA damage repair and apoptosis were further analyzed in hearts by p53 Signaling PCR\narray. The p53 Signaling PCR array includes 24 genes involved in cell cycle regulation.\nResults indicate that nine of these genes were signi\ufb01cantly altered in FLT samples.\nWe found space\ufb02ight increased Cdkn1a/p21 expression 6.8-fold in hearts compared\nto GRD, consistent with reports for other tissues including liver, kidney, bone and mus-\ncle [27,30,31]. CDKN1A (also known as P21), is a potent CDK inhibitor and inhibits cell\ncycle progression at the G1 phase by inhibiting the activity of CDK2 or CDK4. Increases\nin p21 levels in bone from mice in this space\ufb02ight experiment space\ufb02ight were previously\nassociated with proliferative arrest in cultured osteoprogenitors [30]. However, the adult\nmammalian heart itself has limited regenerative ability. Adult p21 levels in adult heart\nare thought to contribute to normal cell cycle arrest in differentiated cardiomyocytes, and\nthere is evidence that cardiomyocytes can divide in the adult human heart [53], though\nit is unlikely that such a small sub-population (1.3% of total) [53] can account for our\n\ufb01ndings. More likely, the elevation in p21 caused by space\ufb02ight may contribute to car-\ndiomyopathies [54] via other cellular processes such as DNA repair, autophagy [38,55,56]\nand senescence. Interestingly, Myc, a mitogenic transcription factor gene that promotes\ncardiac hypertrophy in response to Angiotensin II, was also highly upregulated in the\nspace\ufb02ight heart samples we studied, and its deleterious action can be rescued by p21\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n9 of 16\nre-expression in p21-null mice [57]. Finally, in newborn mammals, p21 elevation might\ninterfere with cardiomyocyte binucleation, an important heart growth mechanism during\npost-natal development [58].\nPTTG1 (Pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1) regulates the cell cycle by inducing\ncyclin D3 and repressing p21 expression [59]. Thus, a decrease in Pttg1 expression (2.4-fold)\nobserved in FLT samples may contribute to the observed increase in expression of p21 in\nFLT samples. In addition to upregulation of cell cycle inhibitors, CDK\u2019s and cyclins such as\nCdk1 and Cdk4 were downregulated in FLT samples, implicating an overall cell cycle arrest\nin space\ufb02ight samples.\nOur results also indicate some apparently contradictory \ufb01ndings, such as the expres-\nsion levels of genes for cell cycle arrest proteins, Chek2 and Btg2, were decreased 2.2- and\n3.5-fold, respectively in FLT samples, contrary to what is expected for Chek2 when Myc is\noverexpressed based on what is observed in lymphoma cells [60].\nThus, one of the crucial \ufb01ndings of our study is that space\ufb02ight alters the expression\nlevels of major cell cycle and cell growth regulators. As the samples analyzed consist\npredominantly (but not solely) of fully differentiated non-dividing cardiomyocytes, this\nsuggests that space\ufb02ight activates p21- and Myc-related pathways to regulate cell growth,\ncardiomyocyte function, and potentially cardiomyopathy, although complex interactions\nsuch as these remain to be elucidated.\n3.3. Apoptosis and DNA Damage Repair-Related Gene Expression in Space\ufb02ight Hearts\nThere were no signi\ufb01cant changes in apoptosis-related genes such as p53, Bax, Bcl2,\nCasp2 or Casp9 (Supplementary Table S2). DNA damage repair genes such as Atr, Xrcc5,\nErcc1 and Apex1 were only moderately altered in space\ufb02ight (1.1- to 1.3-fold), suggesting\nwidespread DNA damage responses were not occurring at the time of sample recovery.\nHowever, we cannot rule out the possibility that space\ufb02ight activates DNA damage and\napoptosis pathways in a smaller sub-population of cell types within the heart during\nspace\ufb02ight, as shown previously for exposure to low dose, heavy ion radiation (16O,\n600 MeV/n) simulating space radiation [61]. Evidence supporting the possibility that\nspace\ufb02ight activates DNA damage pathways and/or apoptosis has been reported for\ntissues other than heart [62], including the thymus [63,64] and the eye [62,64], and multi-\nomics analyses reveal increased levels of DNA damage markers in urine and blood from\nastronauts [26].\n3.4. In\ufb02ammatory Pathway Gene Expression in Space\ufb02ight Heart\nIn\ufb02ammatory response genes, such as Tnf (tumor necrosis factor), Tnfrsf10b (Tnf re-\nceptor superfamily, member 10) and Traf1 (Tnf receptor-associated factor) were signi\ufb01cantly\ndownregulated (9.9-, 1.9- and 2.3-fold decrease) in FLT samples compared to GRD controls.\nTnf is a multifunctional pro-in\ufb02ammatory cytokine, which regulates a wide variety of\nbiological processes such as in\ufb02ammation, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and cyto-\ntoxicity [65]. Space is a hazardous environment and proper immune functioning is crucial\nfor astronaut health and success of space missions. The decreased expression of Tnf, Tn-\nfrsf10b and Traf1 observed in our study suggests downregulation of this pro-in\ufb02ammatory\nsignaling pathway, which may lead to compromised immune function. Our results are\nconsistent with other studies showing space\ufb02ight reduces Tnf expression levels in both\nmice [19,66] and humans [67]. In addition, human T cell cultures on the International Space\nStation (ISS) show a 15-fold decrement in expression of Tnf in T cells and its downstream\neffectors in microgravity as compared to cells centrifuged at 1g [68]. During a very long\nduration space\ufb02ight, TNF\u03b1 expression in the blood of astronauts is elevated [24] but after\nreturn to Earth (between days 0 and 5) as skeletal muscle enters a recovery phase, Tnf\u03b1\nexpression rapidly declines along with other cytokines in the Il6 pathway [69]. Together,\nthese \ufb01ndings implicate a biomechanical, gravity-dependent mechanism for regulating\nTnf-related pathways.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n10 of 16\nAlthough the radiation exposure of mice on the STS-131 mission is considered too\nlow to account for our results, relatively low doses of particle radiation (<30 cGy) can lead\nto altered regulation of disease-related pathways and de\ufb01cits in cardiac function [70,71].\nFurthermore, expression of oxidative stress and in\ufb02ammation markers in the heart caused\nby low dose gamma radiation exposure is exacerbated when combined with hindlimb\nunloading [17]. Further study is needed to determine the in\ufb02uence of space radiation in\ncombination with microgravity, on the heart in the space\ufb02ight environment during long\nduration missions.\n3.5. Gene Networks and Molecular Signatures of Disease\nComputational analysis revealed that changes in a subset of genes that were differen-\ntially expressed due to space\ufb02ight were linked to disease, including immune suppression\nand impairments in glucose homeostasis, consistent with \ufb01ndings in astronauts [72,73].\nIn addition, a subset of the DEGs resulting from space\ufb02ight were associated with cardio-\nvascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular decompensation, hyperten-\nsive disease and myocardial infarction. Cardiovascular decompensation and volumetric\nchanges in blood \ufb02ow were consistent with previous observations in crew members dur-\ning \ufb02ight [3,8,74]. In a previous study on a subset of ISS crewmembers, mean arterial\npressures reportedly do not change signi\ufb01cantly during space\ufb02ight. However, cardiac\noutput and stroke volume are increased in \ufb02ight compared to the seated position on Earth\n(although comparable to the supine position on Earth) [3]. Thus, our \ufb01ndings were con-\nsistent with previous reports on astronauts indicating that space\ufb02ight adversely affects\ncardiovascular health.\nComputational analyses also indicated that space\ufb02ight led to altered regulation of\nmolecular networks within the oxidative damage response and cell proliferation path-\nways. Our \ufb01ndings suggest that oxidative stress and Trp35 signaling pathways were linked\nand that space\ufb02ight alters gene interactions between these two pathways. Furthermore,\ntranscription factors FoxO3, Jun, Myc, and Hif1a were predicted to mediate the interaction\nbetween these two pathways, making these genes promising targets for mitigating gene\nnetwork changes in response to space\ufb02ight. Cat, Cdkn1a, Cdk1 and Cdk4 also were pre-\ndicted to serve as central hubs of gene networks that are altered by space\ufb02ight. Hence,\nthese molecules may be potential targets for the development of countermeasures against\nspace\ufb02ight-induced tissue de\ufb01cits.\n3.6. Limitations\nFor extrapolation of \ufb01ndings from this murine study to humans, there is the inherent\nlimitation of the difference in species as well as a potential in\ufb02uence of the speci\ufb01c strain\nand sex which were selected as subjects. Factors related to experimental protocol also\nimportant to consider when interpreting gene expression \ufb01ndings from this experiment\ninclude the \ufb01xed duration of the mission (15 days), sample recovery only after animals were\nreturned to Earth (3+ hours after landing), and the fact that ground control animals were\nhoused in \ufb02ight-matched habitats but were not exposed to similar forces as the \ufb02ight mice\nencountered during launch and landing. Therefore, observed changes in gene expression\ndid not solely re\ufb02ect changes observed during habitation in microgravity, but for rapidly\nresponding genes, such as Nfe2l2, also may re\ufb02ect re-entry and re-adaptation to 1-gravity\non Earth, however brie\ufb02y.\nAs the scope of our investigation focused on RT-PCR, additional studies are needed\nto elucidate how space\ufb02ight-induced oxidative stress may mediate cell cycle/growth\nand function, to gain deeper insight into how the cardiovascular system responds to the\nspace environment and recovers after return to Earth. Furthermore, because the heart\nconsists of multiple cell types, including cardiomyocytes, \ufb01broblasts, endothelial cells, and\nmacrophages, each with a discrete gene expression pro\ufb01le [53], future experiments could\nfocus on spatial transcriptomics to determine the cellular source of speci\ufb01c gene expression\nchanges, as well as the regulation of protein expression together with cardiac function.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n11 of 16\n4. Materials and Methods\n4.1. Ethics Statement\nAll animal procedures were conducted in accordance with guidelines described by\nthe National Institute of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and\napproved by all relevant committees, including the Institutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee (IACUC) at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames\nResearch Center. The IACUC approval number associated with this animal study was\nNAS-10-002-Y1.\n4.2. Animals and Space\ufb02ight\nThe mice in this study were \ufb02own on the Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS-131\nmission for the experiment \u201cMouse Antigen-Speci\ufb01c CD4+ T Cell Priming and Memory\nResponse during Space\ufb02ight\u201d. The heart tissue used in this experiment was an award\nto E. Almeida as part of the NASA STS-131 Mouse Immunology I Biospecimen Sharing\nProgram (BSP). Female C57BL/6J mice were acclimatized to space\ufb02ight food bars and\nlixits, but were not placed in Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) habitats until just before\nspace\ufb02ight. Mice were divided into two groups: \ufb02ight (FLT) and ground (GRD) control.\nThe NASA AEM units are composed of a stainless-steel grid cage, fan blowers, a layered\n\ufb01lter system, interior lamps, specialized food bars, and a water box. The AEM units are\nself-contained habitats that provide group housing with constant ad libitum access to food\nand water while also providing a waste management system that isolates the animals from\ntheir waste. FLT mice were launched at 14 weeks of age then \ufb02own in space for 15 days\nand were not subjected to any experimental procedures during space\ufb02ight.\nSynchronous GRD control mice were also housed in AEMs, maintained in an orbital\nenvironmental simulator at Kennedy Space Center, and exposed to environmental condi-\ntions matched closely to those of FLT mice on the shuttle (temperature, light/dark cycle,\nhumidity, and carbon dioxide levels). FLT and GRD control animals were weighed before\n\ufb02ight and immediately after return and were subjected to veterinary examination prior to\neuthanasia. Food and water consumption of each group were measured upon recovery.\nAnimals were euthanized at 16 weeks of age starting approximately 3 h after landing using\niso\ufb02urane anesthesia followed by thoracotomy. Euthanasia and dissections proceeded at\na pace of one mouse every 15\u201320 min. The heart was removed and major veins and feed\narteries trimmed off. The hearts of four mice per group were bisected into the cephalic\nand caudal regions, and the caudal halves (ventricles) were frozen in liquid nitrogen for\nlater analysis of gene expression (the remaining hearts from four mice per group were\ndistributed to another BSP investigator). The frozen samples were transported on dry ice\nto NASA Ames Research Center and stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis.\n4.3. RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis\nTotal RNA was isolated from frozen heart tissue by homogenization and RNA extrac-\ntion using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Tissue samples were\nhomogenized in 1 mL of TRIzol reagent and incubated at room temperature for 5 min.\nAfter incubation, 0.2 mL of chloroform was added, the sample agitated vigorously for 30 s\nand then incubated for 2 min at room temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged at\n12,000\u00d7 g for 15 min at 4 \u25e6C. Following centrifugation, the upper aqueous phases were\nseparated and incubated with 0.5 mL of isopropanol for 10 min at room temperature. Sam-\nples were then centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7 g for 15 min at 4 \u25e6C and the RNA pellet was washed\nwith 70% ethanol. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 100 \u00b5L of nuclease-free water and\nfurther puri\ufb01ed using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), per instructions.\nThe quantities and qualities of puri\ufb01ed RNA were determined by measuring absorbance\nat 260 nm and 280 nm using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scienti\ufb01c,\nWilmington, DE, USA). RNA integrity was assessed by running RNA on 0.8% agarose\nformaldehyde-denaturing gel with ethidium bromide and further visualized by Fluor-S\nMultimager (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n12 of 16\nAll RNA samples were analyzed by thematic real time PCR arrays (for Oxidative\nStress and p53-related pathways) or RT-PCR (for Nfe2l2). Although whole transcriptome\nanalysis would be valuable, samples are no longer available for additional analyses.\n4.4. Quantitative Real-Time PCR Array\nAn equal amount of RNA (1 \u00b5g) was used from FLT and GRD samples to synthe-\nsize cDNA using RT2 PCR Array First Strand Kit (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA).\nReal-time PCR was performed using the Oxidative Stress PCR Array (PAMM-065) and\np53 Signaling Pathway PCR Array (PAMM-027) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol\n(SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA). Brie\ufb02y, FLT and GRD cDNA samples were mixed\nwith RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA) and dis-\ntributed across the 96-well plate array. Each of the 96-well plate arrays contained primers\nfor 84 genes related to oxidative stress or p53 signaling pathways and control housekeep-\ning genes (HKG). PCR was performed in a thermal cycler (ABI 7500 Standard, Applied\nBiosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with initial denaturation at 95 \u25e6C for 10 min, followed\nby 40 cycles of 95 \u25e6C for 15 s and 60 \u25e6C for one minute. FLT and GRD cDNA samples\nwere also run on control RT2 RNA QC PCR Array plates (PAMM-999) to test RNA quality,\nreverse transcription ef\ufb01ciency, PCR ef\ufb01ciency and genomic DNA contamination.\n4.5. Nfe2l2 Real-Time PCR\ncDNA was synthesized by using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Va-\nlencia, CA, USA). Brie\ufb02y, 1 \u00b5g of RNA sample was treated with gDNA Wipeout Buffer at\n42 \u25e6C for 2 min then reverse-transcription was performed using Quantiscript RT Buffer\nand Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase as per manufacturer\u2019s instruction. The Real-Time\nPCR mixture was made using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA,\nUSA). Synthesized cDNA from the previous step was mixed with Quantiscript SYBR Green\nPCR Mix and Nfe2l2 primer mixture, per manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Real-time PCR was\nperformed in a thermal cycler (ABI 7500 Standard, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)\nwith initial activation at 95 \u25e6C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u25e6C for 15 s and\n60 \u25e6C for 1 min. Ct values were retrieved by maintaining the same threshold among all\nthe samples.\n4.6. Data Analysis and Statistics\nFor the Oxidative Stress PCR Array (PAMM-065) and p53 Signaling Pathway PCR\nArray, relative expression levels of genes were calculated using the comparative threshold\ncycle method (\u2206\u2206Ct) with normalization to the average expression levels of \ufb01ve house-\nkeeping genes (SABiosciences Data Analysis Software). FLT samples were compared to\nGRD controls using Mann\u2013Whitney U Test using p < 0.05 as the threshold of signi\ufb01cance\nand sample size of n = 4 mice per group.\nFor Nfe2l2 RT-PCR of heart samples, the change in expression levels were calculated\nusing the \u2206\u2206Ct method with Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt) 1 as house-\nkeeping gene. The log2 (linear) normalized expression from \ufb02ight and ground control\ngroups was used in the Mann\u2013Whitney U test at p < 0.05, n = 4 mice per group.\n4.7. Gene Network Predictions and Functional Analysis\nTo generate predictions on potential protein interactions, statistically signi\ufb01cant differ-\nentially expressed genes from both PCR arrays were entered into the String DB protein-\nprotein interaction database [75]. Experimental evidence, databases, and co-expression\nwere used as sources to generate protein interaction networks. The interaction score was\nset to a threshold of \u201cmedium\u201d (0.400).\nToppfun [76] was used to gain insight into whether the differentially expressed genes\nwere linked to human disease phenotypes. Statistically signi\ufb01cant differentially expressed\ngenes were entered into the Toppfun database. The results were \ufb01ltered using a Benjamini\u2013\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088\n13 of 16\nHochberg false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of p < 0.05 and a query to genome overlap\nof four or more genes.\n5. Conclusions\nIn conclusion, our study revealed that space\ufb02ight signi\ufb01cantly altered cardiac expres-\nsion of genes related to cell cycle/growth (notably Cdkn1a/p21, Cdk1, and Myc), in\ufb02amma-\ntion (notably Tnf) and oxidative stress (notably Nfe2l2, Nox1, Ptgs2), which may contribute\nto cardiac dysfunction. These \ufb01ndings provide novel data suitable for developing testable\nhypotheses for further study. Identi\ufb01cation of speci\ufb01c mechanisms and molecules responsi-\nble for excess ROS generation during space\ufb02ight is of considerable interest, and may yield\nnew therapeutic approaches.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/\n10.3390/ijms22169088/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.K.G., E.A.C.A. and A.K.; data analysis, A.K. and\nC.G.T.T.; interpretation of results, R.K.G., E.A.C.A., A.K. and C.G.T.T.; writing\u2014original draft prepa-\nration, A.K. and R.K.G.; writing\u2014review and editing, R.K.G., E.A.C.A. and C.G.T.T.; supervision,\nR.K.G.; funding acquisition, R.K.G. and E.A.C.A.

Irradiation\nacutely stimulates bone remodeling in mice, although the long-term in\ufb02uence of space radiation\non bone-forming potential (osteoblastogenesis) and possible adaptive mechanisms are not well\nunderstood. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation impairs osteoblastogenesis in an ion-type\nspeci\ufb01c manner, with low doses capable of modulating expression of redox-related genes. 16-weeks\nold, male, C57BL6/J mice were exposed to low linear-energy-transfer (LET) protons (150 MeV/n) or\nhigh-LET 56Fe ions (600 MeV/n) using either low (5 or 10 cGy) or high (50 or 200 cGy) doses at NASA\u2019s\nSpace Radiation Lab. Five weeks or one year after irradiation, tissues were harvested and analyzed by\nmicrocomputed tomography for cancellous microarchitecture and cortical geometry. Marrow-derived,\nadherent cells were grown under osteoblastogenic culture conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed by\nRT-PCR during the proliferative or mineralizing phase of growth, and differentiation was analyzed by\nimaging mineralized nodules. As expected, a high dose (200 cGy), but not lower doses, of either 56Fe\nor protons caused a loss of cancellous bone volume/total volume. Marrow cells produced mineralized\nnodules ex vivo regardless of radiation type or dose; 56Fe (200 cGy) inhibited osteoblastogenesis by\nmore than 90% (5 weeks and 1 year post-IR). After 5 weeks, irradiation (protons or 56Fe) caused few\nchanges in gene expression levels during osteoblastogenesis, although a high dose 56Fe (200 cGy)\nincreased Catalase and Gadd45. The addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected\nmarrow-derived osteoprogenitors from the damaging effects of exposure to low-LET (137Cs \u03b3)\nwhen irradiated in vitro, but had limited protective effects on high-LET 56Fe-exposed cells. In sum,\neither protons or 56Fe at a relatively high dose (200 cGy) caused persistent bone loss, whereas only\nhigh-LET 56Fe increased redox-related gene expression, albeit to a limited extent, and inhibited\nosteoblastogenesis. Doses below 50 cGy did not elicit widespread responses in any parameter\nmeasured. We conclude that high-LET irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and\nregulated steady-state gene expression of select redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis, which\nmay contribute to persistent bone loss.\nKeywords: cancellous bone; osteoblast; ionizing radiation; space\ufb02ight; oxidative stress\n1. Introduction\nStructural degradation and oxidative stress following exposure to space radiation potentially\nendangers skeletal health of astronauts, both during the mission and later in life. Weightlessness-induced\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2117; doi:10.3390/ijms18102117\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2117\n2 of 17\nmusculoskeletal atrophy, psychological stress, and confinement pose additional risks to astronaut\nhealth [1]. For exploration missions into deep space, galactic cosmic-rays (GCR) are of particular concern\nbecause of the high-energy and densely ionizing pattern of energy deposition from heavy ions [2\u20134],\nwhich can induce oxidative stress [5,6] in various tissues. Both solar particle-emissions (SPE) and\nGCR contribute to the mixed composition of low-energy radiation (such as protons and \u03b3 rays), high\nlinear-energy-transfer (LET) particles (such as ionized 56Fe- and 12C-nuclei), and secondary constituents,\nsuch as Bremmstrahlung, fragmentation products, and neutrons [4,7]. Estimates of the total absorbed\ndose during a Mars mission (180-day transits with 500-day surface operations) to be between 28\u201347 cGy,\nwith GCR contributing 27 cGy [8,9]. Currently, risk of exposure-induced death from a fatal cancer drives\nthe NASA astronaut career radiation-exposure limit [10], though NASA is investigating additional risks\nassociated with acute and late tissue degeneration following radiation exposure [11].\nIrradiation perturbs the redox balance within the bone and marrow compartment in a complex\nand transient manner. Total-body irradiation (137Cs, 200 cGy) induces rapid reactive oxidative species\nformation in the marrow [12] and increases expression of the master transcription factor that binds to the\nantioxidant response element, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) [13]. Excess reactive oxygen\nspecies (ROS) can interfere with osteogenesis of bone marrow derived osteoprogenitors [14,15] as well as\ncontribute to bone resorption by osteoclasts [16]. High-LET 56Fe (\u2265200 cGy) impairs cell proliferation\nduring osteoblastogenesis from marrow progenitors in a dose-dependent manner [17]. Further, irradiation\nin vitro with 56Fe (100 cGy) arrests the cell cycle and inhibits proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells [18].\nAt higher doses (400\u2013800 cGy), irradiation with X-rays increases ROS, depletes antioxidant stores, increases\nNrf2 protein levels, and reduces differentiation in osteoblast-like cells [19]. However, the role of oxidative\nstress on the potential for total-body irradiation (TBI) to impair osteoblastogenesis over the long term,\nin particular low-dose, high-LET species, has not been fully characterized.\nWe posed three principal questions to address in this study. First, are the severity of acute bone\nloss [12,13,20,21] and impairment of osteoblastogenesis [17] following TBI dependent on radiation type\n(LET) or dose? Secondly, which pathways are activated? Finally, do irradiation-induced insults\nto skeletal structure and osteoblastogenesis persist long after exposure? We hypothesized that:\n(1) irradiation induces bone loss, shown previously to be dominated by total dose of exposure [22],\nand leads to temporal perturbations in antioxidant defenses; (2) TBI induces both persistent changes in\nredox-related genes and cancellous microarchitecture in an ion-dependent manner; and, (3) addition\nof an antioxidant, here the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), mitigates irradiation-induced\ndamage to osteoprogenitors and stem cells when exposed in vitro, implicating an oxidative-stress\ndependent mechanism.\nTo address these questions, we conducted in vivo and in vitro experiments. For in vivo work, we\nselected protons and 56Fe ions as representative radiation for the abundant low-LET particles in space\nradiation and the heavy-ion component of galactic cosmic radiation, respectively. For in vitro work,\nwe selected 137Cs \u03b3 rays as a low-LET reference radiation to enable high-throughput countermeasure\ntesting. In vivo, there were persistent and profound decrements in mineralized nodules after TBI\n(at 200 cGy) with 56Fe, while protons had a milder effect. In contrast to our hypothesis, few changes\nwere observed in the steady-state expression of redox-related genes during ex vivo osteoblastogenesis\nfollowing TBI, although there was some indication of altered expression of select genes during the\nproliferative phase (at 200 cGy 56Fe, but not lower doses). Furthermore, scavenging ROS with an\nantioxidant (i.e., SOD) mitigated adverse effects of in vitro irradiation with \u03b3 rays, but failed to protect\nfully from irradiation with an equivalent dose of heavy ions.\n2. Results\n2.1. TBI Experiment Design\nTo evaluate the individual effects of radiation type, our study queried a dose response to high-LET\n56Fe or low-LET protons (see Methods below for details) at one day, seven days, or \ufb01ve weeks\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2117\n3 of 17\npost-exposure. Additionally, we assessed the sequelae of 56Fe irradiation at a late, 1-year post\nexposure endpoint (Figure 1A,B). Tibiae and femora were collected for assessment of the cancellous\nmicroarchitecture. Bone-marrow cells were cultured ex vivo in osteoblastogenic media for colony\ncounts and mineralization assays. Additionally, the effects of total body irradiation on gene expression\nwere assayed at two points, during the proliferation and mineralization phase, of osteoblastogenesis.\nDay 0\nTissue Harvest &\nMarrow Culture\n+5 weeks\n+1 year\nTissue Harvest &\nMarrow Culture\nUp to \n28 days\n+7\ndays\n19 to 21 \ndays\nqRT-PCR\n(differentiation)\nqRT-PCR\n(proliferation)\nA\nB\nDay 0 +1day\n+7 days\nMarrow ECF \nHarvest\nFigure 1.

Mice were irradiated and euthanized either\none or seven days after exposure. Marrow was collected and cells removed through centrifugation.\nThe supernatant, de\ufb01ned as the extracellular \ufb02uid (ECF), was assessed for total antioxidant capacity.\n2.2. Body Mass Temporal Responses and Coat Color\nBody mass was measured (\u00b10.1 g), at least weekly, throughout the study as an index of general\nhealth (Figure 2, showing the 1-year post irradiation cohorts). As determined by one-way analysis\nof variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett\u2019s posthoc, within six days of exposure, 56Fe (200 cGy) reduced\nthe cohort\u2019s mean body mass by 4% relative to the starting weights. Other doses and ions had no\nsigni\ufb01cant effect relative to starting weights [23]. Shipment of the mice from Brookhaven National Lab\n(BNL) to NASA Ames between days 6 and 8, caused a 5% decline in body weights of all of the groups.\nFollowing shipment, the body mass of all groups rose over time (+7% for the 5-weeks endpoint and\n+46% for the 1-year endpoint), with no treatment effect, nor interaction of time \u00d7 treatment (Figure 2).\nBy the time of euthanasia at 5-weeks or 1-year post-irradiation, body mass did not signi\ufb01cantly differ\nbetween irradiated and age-matched sham-controls.\nAdditionally, as an index of general health, the coat color was assessed as grey or black at the end\nof the experiment (1-year post-irradiation). In sham controls, 1 out of 13 mice had a grey coat (Table 1).\nIn contrast, 56Fe (200 cGy) caused all of the 11 to have grey coats. The lower doses of 56Fe irradiation,\n10 or 50 cGy, did not modulate coat color compared to sham-controls, respectively.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2117\n4 of 17\n \nFigure 2.

Bone Structure\nMicrocomputed tomography was used to assess the effects of aging and irradiation on the\ncancellous tissue in the proximal tibial metaphysis at the 5 week and 1 year endpoints (Figure 1A)\nand cortical geometry of the femoral midshaft at the 1-year endpoint. In sham-treated animal cohorts,\naging caused a 54% reduction of cancellous bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) between the 5-week\n(Figure 3A, 21.1 \u00b1 2.2%) and 1-year (Table 1, 9.7 \u00b1 3.1%) post-treatment endpoints.\nAt 5 weeks post-irradiation, 50 and 200 cGy 56Fe caused a decrement in BV/TV (Figure 3A,\n\u221216% and \u221231%, respectively) and strut number (Tb.N, Figure 3B, \u221216% and \u221231%, respectively)\nin the cancellous region of the proximal tibia, compared to shams. For protons, 200 cGy caused a\n\u221222% decrement in BV/TV (Figure 3A) and Tb.N (Figure 3B), while 50 cGy showed a trend towards\ndecreased BV/TV (\u221211%, p = 0.12) and Tb.N (\u221213%, p = 0.06). Additionally, irradiation at 200 cGy\nincreased trabecular separation, but did not affect trabecular thickness [23]. At 5 or 10 cGy, neither\n56Fe, nor protons, showed any detectable bone loss, by any structural measure.\nAt 1 year post-irradiation, 56Fe (200 cGy) showed a trend of decreased BV/TV and Tb.N\n(\u221225%, p = 0.12, Table 1) in the cancellous region of the proximal tibia, as compared to age-matched\ncontrols. No changes were observed at 10 or 50 cGy doses when compared to controls. Additionally,\nno signi\ufb01cant changes in cortical geometry of the femur at midshaft (bone volume and cortical\nthickness, [23]) were detected, as compared to age-matched controls.\nInt. J. Mol.

Ex Vivo Osteoblastogenesis\nTo assess the cellular responses to irradiation during ex vivo osteoblast growth and maturation,\nwe cultured marrow progenitor cells at the 5 week and 1 year post-irradiation endpoints. For cultures\nplated 5 weeks post-irradiation, gene expression, alkaline phosphatase activity, colony counts, and\nDNA content analyses were performed during the proliferative phase (seven days after plating) and\nmineralization phase (19 to 21 days after plating). At the end of the latter phase, the mineralized area\nwas quanti\ufb01ed to assess the functional outcome of differentiation.\nDuring the mineralization phase, we observed well-formed nodules in the sham and proton-irradiated\n(200 cGy) groups (Figure 4A,B), with sham values displaying wide variance. In contrast, we observed\nvery few, yet fully mineralized, nodules in the 56Fe-irradiated (200 cGy) group (Figure 4A,B). After\nquantifying the nodule area, irradiation with 56Fe (200 cGy) tended to cause a \u221291% decrement (p = 0.06,\nFigure 4A,B) in the mineralization area (median) as compared to sham-irradiated controls. This inhibitory\neffect is consistent with findings from our other experiments with this dose of 56Fe at various times after\nexposure [23]. Although, mineralization area of cultures from animals exposed to protons (200 cGy)\ntended to be lower than sham-controls (\u221270%, p = 0.10, Figure 4A,B), nodules from proton-irradiated mice\nappeared larger and more widespread than in cultures from 56Fe-irradiated mice (Figure 4B). Lower doses\nof either species did not affect mineralized area or any other measured parameters [23].\nRadiation exposure did not modify expression levels for most of the genes analyzed during the\nmineralization phase (Table 2), although a high dose of 56Fe (200 cGy) tended to decrease expression\nof the osteoblast differentiation gene Alpl by \u221260% (p = 0.12), Figure 4C. Additionally, a low dose\nof 56Fe (10 cGy) increased the expression of the antioxidant gene CuZnSOD (+90%) as compared\nto sham-controls, whereas proton exposure did not modify expression levels for any of the genes\nassayed [23]. Taken together, these data suggest mild effects late in culture, but only for 56Fe, not protons.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2117\n6 of 17\nDuring the proliferative phase, most doses and types of radiation exposure did not modify the\nexpression levels for the genes analyzed when compared to sham-controls (Table 2). A high-dose of 56Fe\n(200 cGy) did however increase the expression levels of genes for the cell cycle arrest marker Gadd45\n(+223%) and the antioxidant Catalase (+81%), and also tended to increase the late-osteoblastic marker Bglap\n(+196%, p = 0.08) (Figure 4D). A lower dose of 56Fe (5 cGy) decreased the gene expression of the nitric oxide\ngenerator iNOS by \u221253% and increased Gadd45 by +91%, respectively, when compared to sham controls.\n \nA\nC\n*\nB\nD\n*\n*\n*\n*\nSham\nProton\n56Fe\n200 cGy\n200 cGy\nFigure 4.

Total Antioxidant Capacity of the Marrow Extracellular Fluid\nTo assess the changes in the redox microenvironment in the marrow cavity following irradiation,\nwe measured the antioxidant capacity of the extracellular \ufb02uid from the marrow, (normalized by\nprotein concentration) at one and seven days after exposure to 56Fe or protons (Figure 1B). Protons\n(200 cGy) or 56Fe (200 cGy) decreased the total antioxidant capacity of the marrow extracellular \ufb02uid\nby over 35% within one day of exposure (Figure 6). In contrast, seven days after exposure, protons\ncaused a 62% elevation of antioxidant capacity (Figure 6), whereas 56Fe did not differ from sham\ncontrols. Lower doses of radiation (5 cGy 56Fe or 10 cGy proton), did not modify antioxidant capacity\nper proton concentration with sham-controls at either timepoint.\n \n* *\n*\nSham\n56Fe\nProton\n0    5   10 200 200\n0    5   10 200 200 (cGy)\nFigure 6.

In Vitro Radiation Effects on Osteoblastogenesis\nWe hypothesized that a radiation-induced rise in ROS damages osteoprogenitors, leading to a\ndecrease in number and activity of differentiated progeny and therefore exogenous antioxidant is\nexpected to mitigate adverse effects of radiation on the proliferation and subsequent differentiation of\nosteoprogenitors derived from the marrow. The in\ufb02uence of a low-LET species (137Cs) was compared\nto that of high-LET 56Fe. Adherent marrow cells grown under osteoblastogenic culture conditions\nwere irradiated at day 3 in culture and the percentage change in DNA content between day 3 (day\nof irradiation) and day 10 calculated as a surrogate of culture growth (proliferation). Analysis of the\ndose-response to 137Cs and 56Fe revealed signi\ufb01cant decrements in growth after exposure to 137Cs\n(200 cGy and 500 cGy) or 56Fe (100 cGy, 200 cGy), but not after exposure to lower doses (Figure 7A).\nColony counts also were affected at the higher doses of radiation [23]. In summary, as shown in\nFigure 7A, osteoprogenitors appeared more sensitive to high-LET 56Fe than low-LET 137Cs \u03b3.\nTo begin to assess the contribution of oxidative stress after in vitro radiation exposure of\nosteoprogenitors, several antioxidants (including SOD with and without polyethylene glycol (PEG);\nSOD with nanoparticles or liposomes; Catalase with and without PEG) were screened by addition\nto the culture media, with SOD (without carrier) showing the most promising results [23]. Addition\nof exogenous SOD (200 U/mL) provided twice a day (on day 3 and day 4) effectively protected cell\ngrowth from irradiation with 137Cs, whereas higher doses of SOD or longer periods of treatment were\nless effective [23]. As shown in Figure 7B, addition of SOD prevented the inhibition of growth by 137Cs\n(200 cGy). In contrast, addition of SOD was not as suf\ufb01cient to rescue the cell death incurred after\nexposure to an equivalent dose of 56Fe (200 cGy).\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2117\n9 of 17\nFigure 7.

Discussion\nHeavy-ion irradiation during space missions is a risk to the skeletal health of astronauts, causing\nskeletal degeneration and cellular damage in simulations with rodents [12,20,24]. In this study, we\nsought to elucidate the role of radiation type and changes in the oxidative milieu of bone marrow\nrelated to marrow-derived osteoprogenitor differentiation. We found that low doses (below 50 cGy) of\neither low-LET protons or high-LET 56Fe did not cause observable adverse effects on structure and\nosteoblastogenesis at any endpoint, and, further, did not strongly perturb antioxidant capacity at seven\ndays of exposure (Figure 6) nor expression levels of redox-related genes (Figure 4, Table 2) at 35 days of\nexposure. In contrast, only a high dose of 56Fe radiation (200 cGy) was suf\ufb01cient to induce detrimental\neffects on total antioxidant capacity, bone structure, and osteoprogenitor populations of the marrow\n(Figures 3\u20136). These changes were associated with transient elevations in mRNA levels (Figure 4C,D)\nof an antioxidant gene (Catalase) and a DNA-damage/cell cycle arrest marker (Gadd45) during ex vivo\nosteoblastogenesis, which we speculate indicates persistent oxidative stress or enhanced antioxidant\ndefenses during the proliferative phase. Interestingly, cultures showed a trend towards elevation of\nosteocalcin (Bglap, Figure 4D), a late marker of differentiation, during the proliferative phase, which\nmay indicate that 56Fe exposure accelerated differentiation.\nBody mass and coat color were assessed as general indices of animal health. Body mass indicated\nthat animals showed a modest and transient decline in response to 56Fe irradiation with 200 cGy\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2117\n10 of 17\n(Figure 2), consistent with our previous studies [17]. Additionally, 56Fe irradiation at 200 cGy uniquely\ncaused a shift in coat color from black to grey (Table 1). We interpret this as a hallmark of oxidative\nstress in the hair follicle [25], and, when coupled with the osteoprogenitor effects, this may signal\npremature aging in a second tissue, in line with the free-radical theory of cellular aging [26,27].\nIn rodents, radiation injury to bone between with 56Fe (10\u2013200 cGy, 1 GeV/n) [17] manifests as acute\ncell death of marrow cells and concomitant cancellous bone loss driven by osteoclasts [12,22,28]. In this\nwork, we showed that high-dose 56Fe or proton (200 cGy) caused a transient reduction in antioxidant\ncapacity in the marrow microenvironment (Figure 6), potentially indicative of a depletion of extracellular\nantioxidant stores with subsequent recovery of the extracellular antioxidant defense system [29]. These\nfindings are consistent with our data showing the marrow cell response to increase mRNA expression\nlevels of the master antioxidant transcription factor, Nrf2, shown previously [13], and with effects also\nevident in a cell line at even higher doses [19]. Our group showed that a dietary supplement rich in\nantioxidants and polyphenols (dried plum) prevents bone loss and Nrf2 induction from \u03b3 irradiation\nin mice [30], supportive of the role of oxidative stress in driving acute bone loss. Additionally, in vitro,\n200 cGy 56Fe impairs osteoblastogenesis [17]. Our work extends this high-dose impairment in vivo and\nto five weeks and one year post-exposure, suggesting an irreversible insult to osteoblastogenesis.\nGene expression analyses during the proliferative phase (Figure 4D) revealed that a high dose of\n56Fe (200 cGy) increased the expression of genes for the cell cycle arrest marker Gadd45 and antioxidant\nCatalase relative to sham. These data are consistent with a G2/M arrest from high-LET irradiation of\nmesenchymal stem cells [18], a pre-osteoblast cell line [31], and many other cell types [32]. Interestingly,\nthese two genes are targets of Foxo transcription factors [33\u201335]. Nrf2, Foxos, and p21 are critical to\nthe antioxidant response element [36]. Oxidative stress activates Foxo transcription factors [37] and\ninterferes with Wnt signaling [14,38\u201340]. Hence, our data suggest Foxo activation may play a role in\n56Fe irradiation, decreasing osteoprogenitor cell proliferation, and, ultimately, mineralization levels.\nDuring the mineralization phase (Figure 4A,B), 56Fe irradiation (200 cGy) tended to reduce\nnodule formation and alkaline phosphatase gene expression, suggesting a reduction in early\nmarkers of early-stage osteoblast differentiation and fewer cells contributing to nodule formation,\nconsistent with in vitro evidence for high-dose effects [19]. Taken together with gene expression\ndata, these \ufb01ndings suggest that irradiation induced persistent oxidative stress that impaired colony\nformation via reduced proliferation (e.g., delayed or halted cell division) leading to lower extent of\nmineralization. Higher doses of \u03b3 irradiation (>500 cGy) are required to recapitulate the impairment of\nosteoblastogenesis [41,42], where changes are also associated with oxidative damage [43]. Taking these\n\ufb01ndings into consideration, the sequelae of a high-dose of heavy-ion irradiation are likely impaired\nosteoblastogenesis, which may be attributable to persistent oxidative stress.\nFor evaluating structural responses, we analyzed cancellous regions in the tibia (Figure 3) and\nthe cortical midshaft of the femur (Table 1) at two time points for parameters indicative of structural\nintegrity. At 5-weeks after irradiation, exposure to high-LET 56Fe irradiation at or above 50 cGy\ncaused decrements in fractional bone volume and trabecular number, and increases in trabecular\nspacing (Figure 3), indicating a signi\ufb01cant deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture, consistent\nwith previous \ufb01ndings [20,22,44]. The magnitude of the changes caused by protons or 56Fe were\nsimilar, although the effect of protons at 50 cGy on BV/TV was not statistically signi\ufb01cant (p = 0.12).\nThus, these \ufb01ndings indicate that the threshold for a persistent, 56Fe radiation-induced response lies\nbetween 10 and 50 cGy\u2014doses relevant to exploration missions [11]. Overall, we show that a high\ndose of radiation was able to induce persistent decrements in cancellous bone, regardless of radiation\ntype (Figure 3). Others have shown that these changes persist to four months post-exposure [22].\nIn this study, the structural decrement affected by 56Fe (200 cGy) was resolved one year after exposure\ndue to the expected age-related decline in sham-control animals changes over time (Table 1), likely the\nproduct of age-induced elevations of osteoclasts overtaking waning bone formation by osteoblasts [45].\nThese data are consistent with our previous \ufb01ndings from growing female mice after exposure to\nlow-LET \u03b3 radiation [46]. Although others have shown cortical changes following irradiation with\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2117\n11 of 17\neither low-LET \u03b3 at high doses (500 cGy) [47] or high-LET 56Fe at 50 cGy [48], no irradiation-induced\ncortical responses at 1-year post exposure were evident in this study [23], or in other experiments we\nhave performed in the past. Thus, the in\ufb02uence of ionizing radiation at 200 cGy or below appears to\nbe restricted to the more metabolically-active cancellous tissue.\nIn vitro irradiation studies were conducted to further assess the role of oxidative stress in\nradiation damage to osteoprogenitors. Our approach was to test antioxidants and their capacity\nto rescue radiation effects to provide insight into the different mechanisms between low-LET radiation\nand high-LET radiation [31].\nAlthough similar doses of low-LET radiation are generally less\ndeleterious than high-LET radiation, the mechanisms for radiation damage to primary, marrow-derived\nosteoprogenitors in the context of oxidative stress are not fully elucidated [49\u201351]. When comparing the\neffects of low-LET radiation (137Cs) and high-LET radiation (56Fe), we found high-LET irradiation was\nmore damaging with respect to growth of the cell population, as assessed by a surrogate assay (changes\nin DNA content over time). Furthermore, exogenous SOD effectively protected osteoprogenitors from\nlow-LET radiation damage, but only minimally from 56Fe at 100 cGy, and not at all from 56Fe at 200 cGy.\nTaken together, these \ufb01ndings indicate excess extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibited\ngrowth, and that oxidative stress is possibly the main mechanism involved in low-LET radiodamage\nto osteoprogenitors; in contrast, high-LET species likely affect the cells via additional detrimental\nmechanisms, such as double-strand DNA breaks.\nAlthough others [52,53] have shown the bene\ufb01cial effects of various antioxidants to confer\nradioprotection for various osteoblast cell lines, we show here a direct comparison of antioxidant\ntreatment with different radiation species when added to primary, marrow-derived osteoprogenitors.\nInterestingly, adding SOD at higher doses or for longer periods was not advantageous, emphasizing\nthe importance of carefully titrating radical scavengers such as SOD, possibly to maintain endogenous\nROS-dependent signalling.\nIn sum, we showed the ability of the antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) to mitigate the\nadverse effects of in vitro irradiation with \u03b3 rays (used for the low-LET radiation), but not to an\nequivalent dose of high-LET 56Fe. Our results strengthen the potential application of SOD as a\ncountermeasure for low-LET irradiation-induced damage to marrow stem cells and osteoprogenitors.\nInherent limitations of these experiments with respect to radiation exposures include: (1) exposures\nwere delivered at high dose-rate and fluence in a matter of minutes, whereas in space, the same dose is\ndelivered at a lower rate, and (2) space exposures are mixed doses, rather than a single species (e.g., SPE\ncan deliver 100\u2013200 cGy over days and GCR over years). In addition, with respect to relevance to\nspaceflight, these experiments were performed in mice that were normally ambulatory, thus not subjected\nto musculoskeletal disuse and fluid shifts, which are induced by microgravity; groundbased models for\nspaceflight have shown that unloading can influence radiosensitivity [17,24,54,55].\nIn summary, our \ufb01ndings indicate that although low doses of radiation do not show lasting effects\non skeletal health, a high dose of high-LET 56Fe impairs osteoblast growth and maturation by adversely\naffecting growth of osteoprogenitors. There were few, select changes in steady-state expression of\nredox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis ex vivo after total body irradiation with 56Fe (but not\nprotons), with some indication of altered expression of select genes during the proliferative phase.\nFurthermore, scavenging ROS with antioxidants, such as SOD, mitigated the adverse effects of in vitro\nirradiation with \u03b3 rays (200 cGy), but failed to protect from irradiation with an equivalent dose of\nheavy ions. Together, our \ufb01ndings indicate that high-dose radiation has a persistent effect to impair\nbone formation by adversely affecting growth, but not differentiation, of osteoprogenitors.\n4. Materials and Methods\n4.1. Animals\nMale C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were individually housed\nunder standard conditions and provided food (LabDiet 5001, Purina, St. Louis, MO, USA) and water\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2117\n12 of 17\nad libitum as described by [13]. As a general measure of animal health, we measured body mass weekly\nfor the duration of the study. Additionally, we blindly scored coat color as black or grey at the one-year\npost-irradiation endpoint. Animals were euthanized by cardiac puncture while under iso\ufb02urane\noverdose followed by cervical dislocation. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees for\nNASA Ames Research Center (Protocol NAS-10-001-Y2, 17 February 2011) and Brookhaven National\nLaboratory (Protocol #431, 8 February 2011) approved all of the procedures.\n4.2. In Vivo Experiment Design and Radiation Exposure\nTwo experiments using mice were conducted to assess the effect of radiation type on skeletal\nantioxidant response, osteoblastogenesis, and bone structure. In the first experiment (Figure 1A), conscious\n16-weeks old, male, C57BL6/J mice were exposed to low-LET protons (150 MeV/n, LET ~0.52 keV/\u00b5m)\nor high-LET 56Fe ions (600 MeV/n, LET ~175 keV/\u00b5m) at 5, 10, 50, or 200 cGy at NASA\u2019s Space Radiation\nLab at Brookhaven National Lab (Upton, NY, USA). Between 7\u20139 days after irradiation, mice were\nshipped overnight from Brookhaven to NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA. Select\ngroups of mice were euthanized and tissues harvested after 35\u201338 days for 56Fe, 36\u201339 days for proton,\nor 36\u201338 days for the sham (these three groups are deemed 5 weeks post-irradiation and had n = 8\nper group) and late (358 or 360 days, here deemed 1 year post-irradiation and had n = 13 per group)\nfor ex vivo osteoprogenitor culture of marrow cells. Tibiae or femora were collected for cancellous\nmicroarchitecture assessment with microcomputed tomography. For the 5-week endpoint, osteoblast\ncultures (n = 6\u20137 mice/group) were analyzed by real-time qPCR (n = 4 mice/group, see below for details),\ntotal DNA quantification, and alkaline phosphatase activity during the proliferative phase (seven days\nafter plating) or the mineralization phase (19\u201321 days after plating) stages of osteoblast differentiation.\nAt the termination of cultures, mineralized nodules were imaged and analyzed for percent surface area at\nthe end of the culture period. For the 1-year endpoint, osteoblast cultures (n = 6/group) were analyzed\nfor colony number during the proliferative phase (eight days after plating) or for mineralized nodule area\nduring the mineralization phase (28 days after plating) of osteoblast differentiation.\nIn the second experiment (Figure 1B), we aimed to determine the effects of total-body irradiation\non the antioxidant capacity of the extracellular \ufb02uid surrounding the marrow cells [56]. To evaluate\nion effects, conscious 16-wk old, male, C57BL6/J mice mice were exposed to 10 or 200 cGy of low-LET\nprotons (n = 6\u20138 per group) or 5 or 200 cGy of high-LET 56Fe ions (n = 8 per group) as described above,\nor were sham irradiated (n = 13 per group). Mice were euthanized and tissues harvested at one or\nseven days after exposure, at which point tibial marrow was processed for extracellular \ufb02uid collection\nand quanti\ufb01cation of total antioxidant capacity, described in more detail below.\n4.3. In Vitro Experiment Design and Radiation Exposure\nOsteoprogenitors were grown in vitro from the bone marrow of 16-week old, male C57Bl/6 mice,\nas previously described [17]. Cells were irradiated three days after plating (day 3) with either \u03b3 (137Cs,\nsham or 10\u2013500 cGy, JL Shepherd Mark I) or 56Fe (sham or 50\u2013200 cGy, NSRL), and then grown until\nday 10. Cell behavior was assessed by measuring changes in DNA content between day three and day\n10 (as a surrogate for cell growth) with the Cyquant assay as previously described [17]. For the SOD\nexperiment, multiple doses were tested in preliminary experiments (100\u2013600 U/mL of SOD or vehicle,\nfor 2 or 3 days of treatment at different times). The protocol selected for more extensive dose-response\nexperiments entailed the addition of SOD (200 U/mL), or vehicle (\u03b1-MEM) 2 h before irradiation (day\n3), twice a day, through the 4th day after exposure to radiation. Experiments were repeated 2\u20133 times.\nData were normalized to the sham-control.\n4.4. Total Antioxidant Capacity\nWe measured the antioxidant capacity of the extracellular \ufb02uid of the marrow (i.e., the marrow\nplasma) with a colorimetric assay based on the reduction potential of Cu2+ to Cu1+ as compared to\nTrolox equivalent standards (Oxford Biomedical, Oxford, MI, USA). In brief, we isolated marrow\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2117\n13 of 17\nex vivo, using 150 \u00b5L of sterile saline to \ufb02ush the marrow from the tibial diaphysis, as described\npreviously [56]. The solution was centrifuged and supernatant preserved as the extracellular \ufb02uid at\n\u221280 \u25e6C for further assessment. The BCA assay assessed the protein concentration of the extracellular\n\ufb02uid against albumin standards, which enabled the normalization of the antioxidant capacity by the\nprotein concentration to account for changes in protein levels with treatment [56].\n4.5. Bone Microarchitecture and Geometry\nWe assessed the bone volume and microarchitecture of the cancellous tissue in the proximal\ntibial metaphysis using microcomputed tomography (6.7 \u00b5m pixel size, 3500 ms integration time,\n50 kV, Skyscan 1174; Bruker microCT, Kontich, Belgium) as described in [13].\nFor cancellous\nquanti\ufb01cation, a 1.0-mm thick region located 0.24 mm distal to the proximal growth plate was\nsemi-autonomously contoured to include cancellous tissue. We assessed changes in cancellous bone\nusing the three-dimensional bone volume to total volume fraction (BV/TV, %), trabecular thickness\n(Tb.Th, mm), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), and trabecular\nseparation (Tb.Sp, mm). We assessed the changes in cortical bone at the midshaft of the femur using\nbone volume and cortical thickness. All analyses follow conventional guidelines [57].\n4.6. Ex Vivo Osteoblastogenic Assays and qRT-PCR Analyses\nFor osteoblastogenic culture, femur marrow was \ufb02ushed using saline and treated with lysis buffer\nspeci\ufb01c for red blood cells (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), centrifuged for ten minutes at 1000\u00d7 g,\nand supernatant removed. Cells were then re-suspended and plated at 3.0 \u00d7 105 cells/cm2 in 6-well\nplates. Osteoblastogenic growth medium (alpha minimum essential medium with 15% FBS (Gibco,\nGaithersburg, MD, USA), 1\u00d7 anti-biotic/mycotic, 50 \u00b5g/mL ascorbic acid, 10 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate)\nwas replenished every 2\u20133 days.\nFor qPCR analyses (n = 4/group), cells were collected in a solution of 1% \u03b2-mercapthoethanol\nin RLT Buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and stored at \u221280 \u25e6C until RNA isolation via RNeasy\nminikit (Qiagen). RNA quantity and purity was measured using a nanodrop spectrophotometer\n(Nanodrop 2000, Thermoscienti\ufb01c, Waltham, MA, USA) while RNA quality was assessed using a 0.8%\nnon-denaturing gel. A RT2PCR custom array (PAMM-999A-1, SYBR probes, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)\nwas processed with an Applied Biosystems 7500 cycler to generate gene expression data. The \u2206\u2206Ct\nmethod was used to analyze the raw data. Cycle values above 35 were de\ufb01ned as non-detectable.\nStatistical analyses were performed on log2-transformed data. Fifteen representative genes were\nanalyzed to assess osteoblast differentiation, proliferation, oxidative metabolism, or apoptosis, see\nTable 3. All genes were normalized to housekeeping gene Hprt. Technical issues forced the loss of\none specimen from the 56Fe, 200 cGy group during the proliferative phase and the loss of all four\nspecimens in the proton, 10 cGy group from mineralization phase.\nTable 3.

Quanti\ufb01cation of ALP enzymatic activity and total DNA content\nwas performed using Alkaline Phosphatase Activity Colorimetric Assay (Biovision, Mountain View,\nCA, USA) and CyQuant Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scienti\ufb01c, Waltham, MA,\nUSA), respectively.\nColony counts early in culture assessed the successful adherence and proliferation of colony\nforming units. Parameters de\ufb01ning a colony included having distinct region of radial colony growth\nand having more than 30 cells with a majority of cells having of morphological homogeneity.\nTo quantify densely mineralizing area (i.e., the nodule area), we harvested cultures in the\ndifferentiation phase. First, we washed cultures with saline and scanned the plates at 300 dpi resolution.\nWe quanti\ufb01ed the percentage of well area having mineralizing nodules with Image J, using a custom\nalgorithm to threshold the grayscale image.\n4.7. Statistics\nWe report parametric data with mean and standard deviation (SD). For these data, to determine\nsigni\ufb01cant differences, a 1-way analysis of variance was used followed by Dunnett\u2019s post-hoc test,\nwhich allowed for the comparison of respective radiation types and doses to the age-matched sham\ncontrol (0 cGy). For non-parametric data (i.e., nodule area data, as values near zero display skew), we\nreport the median with interquartile range. For these data, to determine signi\ufb01cant differences, we\nused a Kruskal-Wallis test with a Steel post-hoc test, which allowed for the comparison of respective\nradiation types and doses to the age-matched, sham control (0 cGy). We assessed temporal (within\nsubjects) treatment (between subjects) effects in body mass, and their interaction (i.e., time \u00d7 treatment),\nusing Repeated Measures ANOVA and Wilks\u2019 Lamda test. Throughout, a p-value \u22640.05 was accepted\nas signi\ufb01cant. We performed all analyses using JMP 13 (SAS).\nAcknowledgments: Research was supported by National Space Biomedical Research Institute grant # MA02501\n(RKG, JSA) under NASA cooperative agreement NCC 9-58, a DOE-NASA Interagency Award #DE-SC0001507,\nsupported by the Of\ufb01ce of Science (BER), U.S. Department of Energy (RKG), and NASA Postdoctoral Program\nfellowships (AS, AK, JSA).

Ronca1,2, Richard C. Mains3, Mark J. Shelhamer4, Jeffrey D. Smith1 and Thomas J. Goodwin5\nNASA\u2019s Space Biology and Human Research Program entities have recently spearheaded communications both internally and\nexternally to coordinate the agency\u2019s translational research efforts. In this paper, we strongly advocate for translational research at\nNASA, provide recent examples of NASA sponsored early-stage translational research, and discuss options for a path forward. Our\noverall objective is to help in stimulating a collaborative research across multiple disciplines and entities that, working together, will\nmore effectively and more rapidly achieve NASA\u2019s goals for human space\ufb02ight.\nnpj Microgravity  (2017) 3:5 ; doi:10.1038/s41526-016-0002-8\nINTRODUCTION\nWith the International Space Station (ISS) available for research\nand habitation for the next decade, there is now a precious\nopportunity to signi\ufb01cantly advance the contributions of space life\nsciences and space medicine toward enabling the Exploration\nClass missions (that is, human missions beyond low-Earth orbit).\nSuch missions are currently burdened with signi\ufb01cant anticipated\ncrew health and safety challenges.1 Coordinated research and\ndevelopment are crucial for producing effective countermeasures\nagainst the deleterious in\ufb02uences of space\ufb02ight on the human\nbody. To this end, we emphatically support the development of\ntranslational research efforts at NASA that will facilitate bi-\ndirectional information \ufb02ow between basic and applied life\nsciences and medical operations with the goal to accelerate\ncountermeasure development.\nAs identi\ufb01ed by National Academy committees and embedded\nin the NASA Strategic Plan, a sustainable human space\ufb02ight\nprogram requires robust research at both basic and applied levels\nto make fundamental biological discoveries and to address the\nknown and emerging risks to human health resulting from the\nspace\ufb02ight environment, respectively.2\u20135 The Life Sciences portfo-\nlio at NASA is composed of the Space Biology program (a basic\nscience program), the Human Research Program (HRP, an applied\nprogram), and Medical Operations (Of\ufb01ce of Chief Health and\nMedical Of\ufb01cer). Informal translational research within these\nprograms has taken place at NASA for decades, yet there is a\nneed for a more coordinated effort that enables dynamic\ntranslation that can take rapid advantage of new \ufb01ndings. In\nparticular, the National Academy committees recommended that\nNASA follows key elements of the National Institutes of Health\u2019s\n(NIH)\nmodel\nof\ntranslational\nscience.6,7\nIt\nwas\nspeci\ufb01cally\nrecommended that the coordination and maturation of projects\nbetween each level of research be enhanced to increase knowl-\nedge\ntransfer\nand\nidenti\ufb01cation\nof\npotential\nsolutions\nfor\nastronaut health challenges.2\u20134 Additionally, the translation of\nknowledge to Earth-based medical care has recently begun\nwith the designation of the ISS as a National Laboratory\n(currently through the Center for the Advancement of Science\nin Space).\nIn this paper, we provide context for the current drivers (and\nneeds) for translational research at NASA, brie\ufb02y summarize the\nexperience at NIH, and lay out a two-phased approach for\ntranslational research. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the \ufb01rst phase is\nbasic-to-applied and the second phase is applied-to-operational.\nWe de\ufb01ne the levels of the research continuum as follows,\nconsistent with the Decadal Survey\u2019s Interim Report:5 basic\nresearch aims to generate new biological knowledge using\nbiological systems or model organisms, applied research aims to\ndevelop countermeasures for risks to astronaut health (similar to\npre-clinical research), and medical operations puts countermea-\nsures into practice for astronauts (like operations in the clinic).\nFinally, going into greater depth on the basic-to-applied window\nof translation, we provide examples and recommendations of\nearly-stage research where Space Biology and HRP aim to build\nsynergy between their existing programs. NASA\u2019s Space Biology\nand HRP entities have recently spearheaded communications\nboth\ninternally\nand\nexternally\nto\ncoordinate\nthe\nAgency\u2019s\ntranslational research efforts between basic and applied levels.\nIn this paper, we strongly advocate for translational research at\nNASA, provide recent examples of NASA-sponsored early-stage\ntranslational research, and discuss options for a path forward.

Our\nnarrow translational research focus is therefore de\ufb01ned as the\napplication of basic science discoveries to the development of\nnew preventive and therapeutic approaches supporting optimized\nhuman adaptation to space missions with extended durations and\ndistances from Earth.\nNASA\u2019s human space\ufb02ight challenges\nThe biomedical concerns and risks of human Exploration Class\nmissions, characterized by extended duration space exposures\nand travel far beyond Earth, are not yet fully understood.8 Prior to\nan exploration mission, better de\ufb01nition of these risks, and the\ndevelopment and implementation of countermeasures must be\nachieved to avoid physiological and behavioral changes that\ncould degrade the health, safety and productivity of crew\nmembers during extended ISS habitation and missions beyond\nLow Earth Orbit (LEO). Additionally, during exploration missions,\ntools are needed to monitor and manage individual and crew\nresiliency in the face of unplanned challenges.9\nThe ISS presently accommodates continuous human habitation,\nenabling basic and applied research and testing of new ways to\nthrive in space. ISS offers a unique platform that is facilitating the\nidenti\ufb01cation of requirements for conducting future human\nmissions that could last for years, and the challenges associated\nwith orbiting and even occupying other planets. Exploration Class\nmissions beyond ISS will require detailed knowledge of what\nadaptations can be tolerated and those which must be countered\nfor the long-term. These missions will also require a degree of\noperational resiliency and autonomy never before attempted.\nHuman space exploration is now at a crossroads, and leaving LEO\nwill place increasing demands on space life sciences research to\nsupport such endeavors.\nKey space\ufb02ight-related environmental factors that chronically\nimpact human health and performance during such missions are:\nmicrogravity, con\ufb01nement, and exposure to space radiation.1 We\nchose just four examples, pro\ufb01led below, to demonstrate the\nvalue of translational research in addressing four speci\ufb01c risks\nidenti\ufb01ed by NASA for astronaut health and safety: immune\nresponse, microbe-host interactions, oxidative stress and damage,\nand visual impairment (VI) syndrome. There are many others on\nNASA\u2019s list,10 of course, including some in broad areas such as\nnutrition and sleep, and surely some not yet identi\ufb01ed. For NASA,\ntranslational research has historically been11 and is increasingly\nviewed as essential to better de\ufb01ne and minimize these health\nrisks.\nTranslational research: pioneered by NIH\nNIH has pioneered the translational research challenge since\nabout 2003.7 Several NIH institutes have been established under\nthe National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences6 to\ndevelop a \u201cTranslational Pipeline\u201d linking basic research to pre-\nclinical and clinical investigations7,12 that will lead to eventual\nutilization in the provision of health care. Both the NIH and NASA\nresearch portfolios cover a broad range of spatial scale and\ncomplexity, including microbiology, cell culture, model organisms,\nand an array of human biomedical studies (Fig. 1). NASA can learn\nmuch\nfrom\nNIH\u2019s\nendeavors,\nand\nthe\nimplementation\nof\ncooperative agreements between these agencies could provide\neffective bridges for knowledge sharing.\nRecent NASA drivers toward translational research\nIn 2009, after consultation with NASA, Congress determined that\nan objective reassessment was needed of the basic and applied\nresearch capabilities and resources available to support future\nhuman space exploration. Congress mandated that the National\nResearch Council conduct and publish a \u201cDecadal Survey\u201d\nultimately titled Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration: Life\nand Physical Sciences Research for a New Era.3 The Decadal Survey\nreviewed the research, development, and applications relevant to\nbasic science and human space exploration. The Space Life and\nPhysical Sciences research communities provided major input to\nthe Decadal Survey and helped to shape its many broad\nFig. 1\nThe NASA Life Sciences Translational Path. It moves from basic research to human exploration applications with bi-directionality\noptions. As knowledge is applied along this path (top arrows) questions may arise that can best be addressed by more basic research (bottom\narrows) in order to support further progress toward successful human exploration\nLife sciences translational research at NASA\nJS Alwood et al\n2\nnpj Microgravity (2017)  5 \nPublished in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA\nrecommendations. A key recommendation was to increase the\nintegration of efforts toward conduct of cross-disciplinary, focused\ntranslational research and development with applications to\nhuman space risks and related areas supporting human space\nexploration. Another main recommendation was for NASA to\nconstitute an integrated organization within NASA to manage\nthese efforts. In 2011, the Space Life and Physical Science Research\n& Applications Division was established within NASA\u2019s Human\nExploration and Operations Mission Directorate.\nKey life science elements within the SLPSRA Division include the\nHRP and the Space Biology program (Fig. 2). HRP created and\nmaintains a dynamic Human Research Roadmap that de\ufb01nes\nknown risks, mitigation capabilities, current knowledge gaps, and\nconcepts for future work regarding astronaut health, performance,\nand safety.10 In contrast, Space Biology focuses on de\ufb01ning the\nchanges in basic biological mechanisms as a result of space\ufb02ight\nand has developed a set of Guiding Questions that de\ufb01ne its\nresearch program.13 Despite the programmatic differences, there\nare overlapping research areas within these two programs at the\nbasic-to-applied phase of translation, which are itemized in Fig. 2\nand described below in the Examples section.\nThe\nDecadal\nSurvey\npanels\nmade\nrecommendations\nfor\nresearch priorities throughout the lifespan of the ISS. In Chapter 6\nof the Decadal Survey, the Animal and Human Biology panel (3)\nmade 16 key recommendations spanning multiple systems in the\nbody of vertebrates for conduct of basic and applied research\n(Table 1). The panel indicated that many of these should be\nstudied using a translational framework. Further, the panel\nunanimously stated that animal research be \ufb01rmly integrated in\nthe space life sciences portfolio\u2014both within space-based and\nground-based programs\u2014to drive the translation of knowledge.\nAdditionally, in Chapter 7 of the Decadal Survey, the Integrative\nand Translational Research for the Human Systems panel (3) made\n11 recommendations related to crosscutting issues (CC) for\nhumans in the space environment (Table 2). One goal of this\npaper is to bring stakeholders\u2014U.S. taxpayers, Congress, the\nNational Academies, and relevant science communities\u2014up to\ndate regarding NASA\u2019s progress in building collaborative research\ncommunities in the translational area to pursue these important\nrecommendations.\nNASA\u2019S CURRENT TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH APPROACH\nSeveral\nrecent\nNASA-sponsored\nactivities\ndemonstrate\nan\nincreased Agency commitment to two phases of translation\n(Fig. 1). Within the basic-to-applied phase, a collaborative work-\nshop was held by NASA JSC and ARC in 2004 that addressed\n\u201cAnimal Research in Support of Human Space Exploration\u201d before\nthe translational research terminology was commonly used.14\nFurther, several recent events have been held to systematically\nadvance NASA\u2019s translational research discussions within the basic\nand applied space life sciences communities, including: an\nArti\ufb01cial Gravity Workshop (responsive to the recommendations\nAH9-10 in Table 1 and CC2 in Table 2);15 symposia at the American\nSociety for Gravitational Space Research (ASGSR) annual meetings\nin 201416and 2015;17 and the annual HRP Investigators Workshops\nin 2015 and 2016. Finally, an internal analysis of the Space Biology\nand HRP research plans has pointed to areas, described in the\nexamples section below and in Fig. 2, that are ripe for synergism.\nWithin the applied-to-operational phase, HRP established a\nTranslational Research Institute, in October 2016, with a key goal\nto recruit funded, terrestrial biomedical research entities in\nfurthering NASA translational research goals,18\u201320 and to help\nmature countermeasures and technologies for use in medical\noperations. Taken together, these efforts demonstrate new\nactivities to facilitate translation from basic science to operations.\nBut how can translational research most effectively be pursued\nusing existing resources? Team science is one solution21 and has\nbeen used successfully by NASA in the past. Additionally,\nenhanced institutional coordination within NASA and between\nfederal funding agencies, as well as relevant non-governmental\norganizations,\nis\nneeded\nto\nspur\ntranslation.\nA\nsystematic\napproach to identify collaborative translational opportunities, for\nexample by text analytics,22 would have bene\ufb01ts for investigators\nFig. 2\nSpace Biology and Human Research Bi-directional Synergism. Basic Space Biology research is done mainly with lower-level model\norganisms, cells, and tissues. The HRP conducts biomedical science mainly with humans.

Text analytics is one method\nto systematically and automatically examine published papers for\nlinkages based on common concepts (manifest in authorship,\nkeywords, references, methods). This approach would allow the\nvisualization of domains where research has been explored jointly\nwithin animals and humans or where the gaps in knowledge\nreside.\nThe Decadal Survey (3) provides guidance on how to structure a\nfully-integrated translational program by partitioning the life\nsciences research portfolio into two dimensions. Horizontal\nintegration of projects is the \ufb01rst dimension and requires\nmultidisciplinary approaches to solve complex problems, often\nwithin a given organism type. The second dimension, vertical\ntranslation, requires meaningful interactions among basic, applied,\nand operational scientists to translate fundamental discoveries to\nhuman treatments, such as using cell biology and model organism\nresearch to address human problems, for example in immune\nsystem response challenges.\nThe NIH experience has shown that the horizontal integration of\nresearch knowledge is essential for developing a comprehensive\nunderstanding of physiology and to effectively solve health\nproblems.23 NASA has a successful record in this domain that\nshould continue, for example, with its BioSpecimen Sharing\nPrograms. Researchers have recently shared tissues from speci\ufb01c\nanimals on a late Shuttle mission (STS-131),24\u201331 and the most\nrecent Russian Bion biosatellite mission;32\u201335 sharing was in the\nform of preserved tissues from NASA\u2019s Life Sciences Data\nArchive.36 Further, new Omic-science studies like NASA\u2019s emer-\nging GeneLab open-science data and biosample repository37 and\nthe recent astronaut Twins Study38 enable big-data collection,\nanalytics, and horizontal integration. Finally, restoring the gravity\nvector arti\ufb01cially via chronic whole-body centrifugation may solve\nissues in multiple tissues, simultaneously.\nIn contrast, vertical translation requires that investigators along\nthe research continuum from basic to operational (Fig. 1) interact\nregularly to share ideas. Examples of vertical translation at NASA\nare in the recent International Life Sciences Research Announce-\nment awards (NASA, European, Japanese, and Canadian space\nprogram research solicitations),39 GeneLab,37 and the recent call\nfor proposals in the area of arti\ufb01cial gravity (AG).40 All of these\nplanned research projects span multiple levels of the translational\npipeline. Additionally, vertically-integrated team science occurs\nthrough NASA Specialized Centers of Research (NSCOR)41\u201344 and\nthe National Space Biomedical Research Institute\u2019s centers for\nradiation research,45\u201347 which aim to identify and translate\ncountermeasure candidates for radiation-induced insults (Table 2:\nCC7\u2013CC9). There is surely untapped value to be derived from\nadditional vertical translation within NASA programs. Some\nexisting overlap and synergism between HRP and Space Biology\ngoals and approaches amenable to both horizontal and vertical\ntranslation are shown in Fig. 2.\nInformally, vertical translation has occurred at NASA for many\nyears11 with a conceptual maturation path shown in Fig. 1. For\nexample,\nmolecular\nmechanisms\nunderlying\nthe\nbone\nloss\nresulting from musculoskeletal disuse have been demonstrated\nin ground-based models,48\u201350 responding to recommendations\nAH2-4 (Table 1). Further, two precursors to osteoporosis drugs\nhave been tested in space-\ufb02own or ground-based mice and\nshown to be effective at preventing weightlessness-induced bone\nloss,49\u201351 responsive to recommendations AH2, AH4 (Table 1).\nThus, these drugs give HRP and Medical Operations additional\npotential countermeasures besides exercise52 and Alendronate53\nto combat bone loss during space\ufb02ight. Additional speci\ufb01c\nexamples of vertical translation are described in the examples\nbelow.\nTable 2.\nCrosscutting Issues (CC) for Humans in the Space Environment identi\ufb01ed in Chapter 7 of the Decadal Survey (3)\nIdenti\ufb01er Recommendation\nCC1\nTo ensure the safety of future commercial orbital and exploration crews, quantify post-landing vertigo and orthostatic intolerance in a suf\ufb01ciently large sample of returning ISS crews, as part of the\nimmediate post-\ufb02ight medical exam.\nCC2\nDetermine whether AG is needed as a multisystem countermeasure and whether continuous large radius AG is needed or intermittent exercise within lower-body negative pressure or short-radius AG\nis suf\ufb01cient.

These examples illustrate ongoing oppor-\ntunities for synergy between basic and applied researchers and\nthese NASA programs to enhance and accelerate health-risk\nreduction.\nImmune response\nThe immune system is constantly adapting and is particularly\nresponsive to unique environments such as those in space\ufb02ight,\nespecially for exposures of the long durations required by\nexploration missions beyond LEO. Immune system dysregulation\n(decreased responsiveness) has been seen during and after\nspace\ufb02ight and ground-space analog tests by studying humans,54\nanimals,55 and relevant cell cultures56 and are a priority area for\nstudy (AH13-15, Table 1). The speci\ufb01c causes are not yet clear, but\nare likely linked to one or more of the following factors:\nphysiological stress, circadian rhythm disruption, microgravity\nexposure, isolation, altered nutrition, or radiation exposure.57\nFurther, the space\ufb02ight environment compounds crew health risks\nas some microorganisms become more virulent (see below) and\nresistant to antibiotic drugs.\nEven though the reactivation of latent viruses has been well\ndocumented in crewmembers,58 it is still unclear if the compro-\nmised immune response can lead to increased susceptibility to\ndisease. There is not a suf\ufb01ciently accurate ground-based analog\nto study immune suppression from space\ufb02ight. However, extreme\noccupational environments such as Antarctica winter-over and the\nAquarius undersea station enable aspects of immune dysregula-\ntion to be studied under similar stressors. Additionally, many\nvaluable analog studies with animals and cells have been\nconducted, including unloading of rodents,59 and cell cultures\nand bioreactors.56,60 These studies have investigated immune\nresponse mechanisms and can allow the use of controlled diets,\nincreased radiation levels and other factors that are not possible in\nhuman research.\nMicrobe-host interactions\nPreventive measures limit the presence of many medically\nsigni\ufb01cant\nmicroorganisms\nduring\nspace\ufb02ight\nmissions,\nbut\nmicrobial infection of crewmembers cannot be completely\nprevented. Space\ufb02ight experiments have demonstrated unique\nand heterogeneous microbial responses in space\ufb02ight ecosystems\nand\ncultures,61,62\nalthough\nthe\nmechanisms\nbehind\nthose\nresponses and their operational relevance remain unclear. In\n2007, the operational importance of these microbial responses\nincreased, as the results of Space Biology experiments aboard\nSTS-115 and STS-123 demonstrated that an enteric pathogen\n(Salmonella typhimurium) increased in virulence in a mouse model\nof infection,63,64 responding to recommendation AH15 (Table 1).\nThese studies can improve our understanding of the potential\nconsequences to astronauts of elevated microbial virulence during\nlong-duration missions.\nEvidence for increased microbial virulence has recently been\ncollected and reported from both space\ufb02ight-analog systems and\nactual space\ufb02ight.61,65,66 Although the conduct of virulence\nstudies during space\ufb02ight is challenging and often impractical in\nhumans, data are being collected as part of the ISS Microbial\nObservatory,62 recent astronaut and rodent microbiome stu-\ndies,67\u201369 and the edible plant studies (e.g., Veggie).70,71 When\navailable, these results can improve our understanding of the\nastronaut-microbe interaction and of the potential health risks to\nthe astronaut.\nOxidative stress\nThe novel environmental conditions of space\ufb02ight, and their\ncombination, may affect both the generation and safe processing\nof reactive oxygen or nitrogen species.72,73 Evidence for oxidative-\nrelated issues in astronauts (or their analogs) can be found in the\nHRP Evidence Reports covering inadequate nutrition,74 extravehi-\ncular activity,75 and exposure to ionizing radiation.47,76\u201379 NASA\nhas successfully used horizontally-integrated team science to\nunderstand\nand\nmitigate\ncomponents\nof\nradiation-induced\noxidative stress42\u201344 in mice.\nVisual impairment/intracranial pressure (VI/IP)\nDuring and after long-duration space\ufb02ights, some astronauts have\nreported noticeable, persistent VIs accompanied by ophthalmic\nchanges including globe \ufb02attening, choroidal folds, optic-disc\nedema, and optic-nerve kinking.80 To date, clinically signi\ufb01cant\nchanges have been observed in male, but not female, astro-\nnauts,81 identifying a not yet understood sex difference, CC10\n(Table 2). Increased intracranial pressure and optic-disc swelling\n(papilledema)\nmay\nunderlie\nthese\npotentially\nirreversible\nchanges.81 Current research is analyzing the effects of lowering\ncranial hypertension by using lower body negative pressure in\nastronauts during \ufb02ight and bedrest,82 supporting the CC2 goal\n(Table 2).\nClinical signs and symptoms observed in astronauts have\ninformed and focused important mechanistic studies exemplifying\nreciprocal translation at NASA (i.e., applied to basic). For example,\nretinas of female mice \ufb02own on the shuttle (STS-133, STS-135),\nacquired by the BioSpecimen Sharing Program, exhibit altered\ngene expression and increased oxidative stress,83 possibly causing\nretinal damage, degeneration, or remodeling.84,85 Other basic\nresearch is examining morphological, histological, and molecular\nchanges in the brains and eyes of rats exposed to head-down\ntilt.86\nAltogether, these examples are in the early stages of mechan-\nistic understanding and countermeasure development. Already\neach has bene\ufb01ted from translational approaches. We suggest\nthat a more coordinated programmatic effort of horizontal and\nvertical integration will accelerate countermeasure development.\nIn the closing section, we provide suggestions of how enhanced\ntranslational research could materialize at NASA.\nOPTIONS FOR NASA\u2019S FUTURE TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH\nPATH\nGiven the need for acute astronaut countermeasures to enable\nlonger-duration missions, we recommend the following steps to\ncatalyze\ntranslational\nresearch\nwithin\nNASA\u2019s\nLife\nSciences\nportfolio.\nBuilding and managing partnerships\nGreater coordinated efforts in translational research are needed to\nunderstand and manage the integrated organismal response to\nspace\ufb02ight and enable human exploration. Current activities\nwithin NASA\u2019s SLPSRA Division are creating new opportunities\nfor translational science both within and external to the Agency.\nTools like text analytics should aid in managing the life sciences\nportfolio and identify new gaps in knowledge. Other government\nagencies, such as NIH, and other organizations, both commercial\nand non-pro\ufb01t, have been working for a number of years on Earth-\nbased translational research goals. NASA should partner, both\nnationally and internationally, with external organizations to\nbene\ufb01t from their tools, techniques, and experience, and add\nLife sciences translational research at NASA\nJS Alwood et al\n6\nnpj Microgravity (2017)  5 \nPublished in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA\nNASA-unique data and translational research efforts to the much\nlarger, continually growing, and worldwide community of transla-\ntional research science.\nNew collaborations\nNASA\u2019s Human Research and Space Biology programs should\nincreasingly\nencourage\ntranslational\nresearch\nproposals\nfor\nupcoming NASA research announcements (NRAs),87 including\nproposals that span traditional program boundaries or team\nscience proposals (horizontally or vertically-integrated teams of\ninvestigators like the NSCORs or resembling the P01 Program\nProject Grants offered by NIH). Additionally, phased awards\nallowing progression from hypothesis-driven science to counter-\nmeasure development would enable vertical translation across\nNASA\u2019s life sciences portfolio (Figs. 1, 2). Finally, proposals with\ninternational collaborations are encouraged to leverage the ISS\nplatform and unique national resources (see the open NRAs and\nthe International Space Life Sciences Working Group for research\nannouncements).\nNASA\u2019s open science and data sharing\nOpen Science approaches, allowing transparency and data sharing\nat all levels of society, are being developed at NASA to provide\ngreater access to data and tissue sharing from both space and\nground-based research. The goal is to engage researchers both\nwithin and outside of the NASA community (e.g., academia, NIH,\nDepartment of Defense, etc). These steps are essential for both\noptimizing the use of these valuable resources and facilitating\ntranslational research goals. NASA should continue the develop-\nment and expansion of Open Science systems, such as GeneLab,\nto enable translational\nresearch\nfor the\nbroadest research\ncommunity.\nEducation, communications, and advocacy\nIncreased activity in the Education, Communication, and Advocacy\nareas will be fundamental to achieve translational research goals\nand is a mandate of the HRP Translational Research Institute.\nAdditionally, organizations such as the ASGSR are discussing\noptions to engage their members who span biology, human\nresearch, physical sciences, life support, related technology\ndevelopment,\nand\ncommercial\napplications\nin\ntranslational\nresearch pursuits. NASA should develop research fellowships, as\nwell as educational and scienti\ufb01c communication materials\nspeci\ufb01cally tailored to the Agency\u2019s translational research goals\nand partner with external organizations, wherever possible, to\nleverage the advocacy those organizations can provide.\nCLOSING\nIn summary, translation research is a two-phased effort at NASA\nand\nwill\nhelp\naccelerate\ncountermeasure\ndevelopment\nfor\nexploration missions. We have speci\ufb01ed four areas where synergy\nwithin the existing program structures seems promising and have\nsuggested ways in which program coordination and team science\napproaches can facilitate translation from discovery to develop-\nment to implementation.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nMany of the ideas and concepts re\ufb02ected in this perspective were prepared by and\npresented at recent NASA Workshops by our colleagues: William Paloski (Director,\nNASA JSC HRP), David Tomko (NASA HQ, Program Executive, Space Biology Program),\nand Barbara Corbin (NASA JSC, Deputy Manager, HRP).

In small animals, such as in rats and mice, cyclic loading experiments are particularly challenging to\nperform in a precise manner due to the small size of the bones and di\ufb03cult-to-eliminate machine compliance.\nAddressing this issue, we developed a precise method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse\nvertebral bodies. The method has three key characteristics: 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel\nsurfaces of the tiny vertebrae; pivotable loading platens to ensure uniform contact and loading of specimen\nsurfaces; and specimen-speci\ufb01c micro-CT-based \ufb01nite element analysis to measure sti\ufb00ness to prescribe force\nlevels that produce the same speci\ufb01ed level of strain for all test specimens. To demonstrate utility, we measured\nfatigue life for three groups (n = 5\u20136 per group) of L5 vertebrae of C57BL/6J male mice, comparing our new\nmethod against two methods commonly used in the literature. We found reduced scatter of the mechanical\nbehavior for this new method compared to the literature methods. In particular, for a controlled level of strain,\nthe standard deviation of the measured fatigue life was up to 5-fold lower for the new method (F-ratio = 4.9;\np < 0.01). The improved precision for this new method for biomechanical testing of small-animal vertebrae\nmay help elucidate aspects of bone quality.\n1. Introduction\nA number of diseases, including osteoporosis (Bouxsein, 2003a;\nSaito and Marumo, 2010) and type II diabetes (Janghorbani et al.,\n2007; Vestergaard, 2007; Farr and Khosla, 2016; Rubin and Patsch,\n2016), are thought to increase fracture risk due in part to deteriorated\nbone quality. That is, these diseases may result in detrimental changes\nto mechanical behavior that are not directly associated with reductions\nin bone mass (Hernandez and Keaveny, 2006). Concerns over possible\nchanges in bone quality have also caused the FDA to require extensive\npre-clinical animal testing on any new treatments (Mosekilde, 1995;\nOminsky et al., 2011). In assessing bone quality, various mechanical\nproperties can be measured (Hernandez and Keaveny, 2006; Turner and\nBurr, 1993; Fyhrie and Christiansen, 2015), typically sti\ufb00ness, strength,\ntoughness, and ductility. All these properties are obtained from\nmonotonic loading. In addition, the response of bone to cyclic\n(repetitive) loading may be important for bone quality assessment if\nsuch loading produces unique failure mechanisms (e.g. slow crack\ngrowth, microdamage accumulation) that are not manifested in\nmonotonic loading (Kruzic and Ritchie, 2008; Nalla et al., 2003). Bio-\nmechanical testing of any type is challenging to perform in a precise\nmanner in small animals, such as in rats and mice, due to the small size\nof the bones and the inevitable machine-compliance e\ufb00ects that are\ndi\ufb03cult to eliminate. Furthermore, for cyclic loading, loss of test spe-\ncimens during the experiment and the substantial variation in cyclic-\nloading responses both serve to reduce statistical power (Brouwers\net al., 2009), which in turn can lead to inconclusive \ufb01ndings regarding\nthe role of bone quality.\nAs a result of these challenges, and because of the continuing in-\nterest in bone quality (Bouxsein, 2003b; Seeman and Delmas, 2006),\nthere remains a need to re\ufb01ne the experimental protocols for bio-\nmechanical testing of small-animal bone specimens, particularly for\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.bonr.2018.10.002\nReceived 9 October 2018; Accepted 17 October 2018\n\u204e Corresponding author at: 5124 Etcheverry Hall, Mailstop 1740, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-1740, USA.\nE-mail address: tonykeaveny@berkeley.edu (T.M.

Here, we report on a method for cyclic biomechanical\ntesting of the mouse lumbar vertebra ex vivo that has improved pre-\ncision. This technique should help optimize statistical power in animal\nexperiments, thus improving the ability of researchers to detect me-\nchanically relevant changes in bone quality due to aging, disease, or\ntreatment, particularly for any situation in which samples sizes are\nlimited in number.\n2. Materials and methods\nWe \ufb01rst present our new method in detail. Then, to demonstrate\nutility, we describe results from cyclic testing experiments for three\ngroups (n = 5\u20136 per group) of L5 mouse vertebrae, comparing results\nfor our new method (referred to as \u201cKFEA method\u201d) against two existing\nmethods from the literature (referred to as \u201cKEXP method\u201d and \u201cFMAX\nmethod\u201d) (Brouwers et al., 2009; Caler and Carter, 1989; Bowman\net al., 1998; Haddock et al., 2004; Lambers et al., 2013; McCubbrey\net al., 1995).\n2.1. Animals\nOur experiments used L5 vertebrae obtained post-mortem from\nmale C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Labs, Sacramento, CA) that were in the\ncontrol groups of various previous studies (unpublished). All original\nstudies, and this study, were approved by NASA Ames Research Center\n(ARC) Animal Care & Use Committee, and all experimental testing was\nconducted at NASA ARC. Ages of the mice ranged from 15 to 18 weeks.\nAfter sacri\ufb01ce, the L1-S1 spinal segment was excised from the mouse\nwith a scalpel via an anterior approach. The L5 vertebra was then se-\nparated by slicing through the adjacent intervertebral discs, gently\ncleaned of soft tissue, wrapped in saline-soaked gauze (Gibco PBS 1X,\npH 7.4), and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until specimen preparation.\n2.2. Specimen preparation\nObtaining true plano-parallel surfaces, which is di\ufb03cult for such\nsmall specimens (Brouwers et al., 2009), is important to ensure full\ncontact \u2014 and thus uniform compression \u2014 between the specimen\nsurface and loading platens. If plano-parallel surfaces are not achieved,\nor if the loading platens are not perfectly parallel, local contact can\noccur over just part of the specimen surface. This introduces unwanted\nscatter in the mechanical response and perhaps also premature failure.\nThus, we developed a detailed method for this aspect of the specimen\npreparation (Fig. 1). Each vertebra was aligned inside a 3D-printed\n(Stratasys Dimension SST 1200es, Eden Prairie, MN), disposable jig\nwith a metal pin (diameter range 0.91 to 0.99 mm; length of 38 mm)\n(Fig. 1A) and secured with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The\ncombined jig-bone construct was then positioned in a diamond-saw\nmicrotome (Leica SP1600 Saw Microtome, Wetzlar, Germany). Two\nparallel cuts were made on the cranial and caudal surfaces under con-\nstant irrigation to remove only the endplates (Fig. 1B), preserving the\nmaximum amount of bone tissue. A \ufb01nal cut through the posterior\npedicles released the vertebral body from the jig (Fig. 1C).\n2.3. Quantitative micro-CT imaging\nAfter machining, specimens were imaged using quantitative micro-\nCT (\u03bcCT 50, Scanco Medical AG, Bruttisellen, Switzerland) at a 10-\u03bcm\nvoxel size (55 kV, 109 \u03bcA, 1000 projections per 180\u00b0, 500 ms integra-\ntion time) (Fig. 2). Specimens were returned to the freezer after ima-\nging. The micro-CT images of the whole specimen (cortical and trabe-\ncular compartments) were then analyzed for height, minimum tissue\ncross-sectional area (minimum value of tissue area at any cross-section,\nover all cross-sections), and total bone volume fraction (BV/TV) (Im-\nageJ 1.51h, Java 1.6.0). Each specimen with cortices removed was then\nevaluated\nfor\ntrabecular\nmicro-architecture\n(Scanco\nEvaluation\nSoftware v6.0): trabecular bone volume fraction (Tb.BV/TV), number\n(Tb.N), thickness (Tb.Th), and separation (Tb.Sp).\n2.4. Calculating specimen-speci\ufb01c cyclic forces\nWe used a force-control loading protocol, which allows both creep\nand damage to occur during cyclic loading. However, since the cyclic\nloading response of bone appears to be determined by the magnitude of\nthe applied strain (as opposed to the magnitude of stress) (Nalla et al.,\n2003; Keaveny et al., 1994a; Keaveny et al., 1994b), our protocol re-\nquired us to calculate a specimen-speci\ufb01c level of applied force that\nwould result in the same level of initial apparent strain (calculated over\nthe entire specimen) for all specimens. Cyclic loading in force control in\nthis way should minimize scatter in the resulting fatigue life despite the\nheterogeneity in size, shape, and microarchitecture of the mouse ver-\ntebrae.\nThis protocol required measuring the overall vertebral sti\ufb00ness\nbefore starting the cyclic loading so that the prescribed apparent strains\n(\u03b5min and \u03b5max) could be converted into specimen-speci\ufb01c levels of ap-\nplied force (Fmin and Fmax). However, experimentally measuring sti\ufb00-\nness for any bone is challenging due to di\ufb00erent types of machine\ncompliance errors, which can introduce both \ufb01xed and random errors\n(Odgaard et al., 1989; Odgaard and Linde, 1991; Keaveny et al., 1993;\nKeaveny et al., 1997). The \ufb01xed errors have implications for external\nvalidity, but otherwise do not compromise comparisons within any\ngiven experiment and are therefore oftentimes acceptable. However,\nlarge random errors compromise statistical power, particularly when\nsample sizes are < 10 per group. Thus, to circumvent any errors asso-\nciated with machine compliance, we used a computationally derived\nsti\ufb00ness (KFEA) that was obtained from specimen-speci\ufb01c, micro-CT-\nbased, linearly elastic, voxel-based \ufb01nite element analysis. The models\nused 10-\u03bcm sized cube voxels, and assumed a nominal value of 10 GPa\nfor the tissue-level (voxel) elastic modulus for all specimens (see\nAppendix A for details). The specimen-speci\ufb01c cyclic forces (Fmin; Eq. 1\nand Fmax; Eq. 2) were then calculated for each specimen using KFEA, the\nspecimen height (H) as measured from micro-CT, and two assumed\nnominal values of initial apparent elastic strain (\u03b5min = 0.05% and\n\u03b5max = 0.5%):\n=\nF\nK\nH\u03b5\nmin\nFEA\nmin\n(1)\n=\nF\nK\nH\u03b5\nmax\nFEA\nmax\n(2)\nThe assumed value of \u03b5max = 0.5% was chosen empirically by trial\nand error based on earlier preliminary experiments on 6 mouse ver-\ntebral specimens. There, we found that the resulting Fmax value was\napproximately half of the directly measured ultimate force, which\ngenerally placed a specimen in the middle region of its fatigue life. The\nminimum initial elastic apparent strain value was chosen such that the\nresulting Fmin values were near 1 N.\n2.5. Mechanical testing\nWithin one week after imaging, specimens were thawed again to\nroom temperature and prepared for cyclic loading in uniaxial com-\npression to failure. The vertebral body was positioned onto the center of\nthe lower platen of the material testing device (TA ElectroForce 3200,\nEden Prairie, MN). Because obtaining perfectly parallel loading platens\ncan be challenging, the upper platen comprised a spherically-seated\nplaten on a lubricated ball-bearing which allows the platen surface to\nrotate and mate \ufb02ush with the sample surface to achieve uniform\ncontact (Fig. 3); with the pre-load in place, the set screws on the upper\nplaten are locked. We used a compressive pre-load of 1 N, and after the\nplaten was locked room-temperature saline-solution (Gibco PBS 1X,\npH 7.4) was added to the bath until the specimen was fully submerged.\nThe pre-load was then adjusted to the predetermined Fmin, and then\nsinusoidal cycles of compression between Fmin and Fmax were applied at\nM.M. Pendleton et al.\nBone Reports 9 (2018) 165\u2013172\n166\na frequency of 8 Hz until the specimen reached 10% strain, measured\nvia the actuation of the testing device platens.\n2.6. Outcome measurements\nThree plots were produced from each specimen fatigue test to de\ufb01ne\noutcome measurements. First, the force-displacement data were plotted\nfor each loading-unloading cycle, from which sti\ufb00ness was de\ufb01ned as\nthe secant sti\ufb00ness, or range of force divided by range of displacement\nper cycle (Fig. 4A). Second, the apparent strain per cycle was plotted,\nand was separated into three curves representing total strain, creep\nstrain, and damage strain (Fig. 4B). The total-strain curve was used to\n\ufb01nd the number of cycles to failure, or fatigue life (Nf) and strain to\nfailure (\u03b5f) using the point of intersection between the curve and a 0.5%\nline o\ufb00set parallel to a line of best \ufb01t for the secondary region\n(Brouwers et al., 2009; Bowman et al., 1998). Third, we plotted sti\ufb00ness\nper cycle (Fig. 4C) to identify three variables: elastic sti\ufb00ness of the\nspecimen (Kelastic), sti\ufb00ness at failure (Kf), and rate of sti\ufb00ness de-\ngradation. Elastic sti\ufb00ness was calculated as the average sti\ufb00ness\nover \u00b1 500 cycles centered about the maximum value of sti\ufb00ness\n(Kmax), which typically occurred after a few thousand cycles of loading;\nthe sti\ufb00ness at failure was de\ufb01ned as the sti\ufb00ness measured at cycle Nf;\nand the rate of sti\ufb00ness degradation (\u0394K/\u0394N) was calculated as the\nslope of a line that best \ufb01t the middle 50% of points in the range be-\ntween Kmax and Kf. The \u0394K/\u0394N parameter re\ufb02ected accumulation of\nfatigue damage, larger values indicating a more rapid accumulation of\nfatigue damage per loading cycle.\nIn addition to these fatigue parameters, we also calculated an ef-\nfective elastic tissue modulus (Etissue, in GPa, Eq. 3). This was calculated\nusing both the experimental (Kelastic) and computational (KFEA) assess-\nments of sti\ufb00ness, scaling with respect to the assumed nominal value of\nthe tissue-level modulus of 10 GPa in the \ufb01nite element analysis:\n\u239c\n\u239f\n=\n\u239b\n\u239d\n\u239e\n\u23a0\nE\nK\nK\n10\ntissue\nelastic\nFEA\n(3)\n2.7. Alternative methods for calculating specimen-speci\ufb01c cyclic forces\nTwo published methods were also implemented to demonstrate\nFig. 1. Machining of a parallel-planed vertebral body. A: A 3D-printed, disposable, plastic jig was designed to securely grip the specimen during machining. A\nvertebra is placed into the jig using a snugly \ufb01t, metal alignment pin (gold) through the vertebral foramen (pin diameter 0.9\u20131 mm) and sits in a diameter-matched\nchannel. The spinous process is oriented into the jig's shallow well, which is then \ufb01lled with PMMA (blue) to secure the vertebra. B: Once the PMMA is set, the pin is\nremoved and two plano-parallel cuts (red) through the endplates are made using a diamond-saw microtome (not shown).

Pendleton et al.\nBone Reports 9 (2018) 165\u2013172\n167\nutility of the new method. For the \ufb01rst \u201cKEXP method\u201d (Brouwers et al.,\n2009; Caler and Carter, 1989; Bowman et al., 1998; Haddock et al.,\n2004; Lambers et al., 2013), instead of using the \ufb01nite element-derived\nvalue of sti\ufb00ness (KFEA), the experimental measurement KEXP was used.\nFollowing literature protocol, KEXP was found by pre-loading the spe-\ncimen in compression to 1 N, cycling between 1 and 10 N 20 times, and\nusing the slope from the force-displacement curve of the 20th cycle. All\nother mechanical testing details were the same as for our new method\nexcept for two di\ufb00erences in the KEXP method: 1) the upper platen used\nwas a rigid design (not adjustable); and 2) the cyclic frequency was\n2 Hz. However, fatigue behavior of bone has been shown to be un-\naltered for any loading frequency below 15 Hz (La\ufb00erty, 1978;\nYamamoto et al., 2006).\nFor the second \u201cFMAX method\u201d (McCubbrey et al., 1995), Fmax was\ncalculated using the measured strength of the adjacent L4 vertebra,\nobtained by monotonic compression to failure. The L5 strength was\nestimated as the product of the L4 strength and the ratio of minimum\ntissue cross-sectional areas (micro-CT) for the L4 and L5 vertebrae, and\nFmax was then calculated as 50% of the L5 force (See Appendix B,\nTable 2 for further details). All other mechanical testing details were\nthe same as our new method.\nFig. 3. Experimental test set-up for fatigue test shown with spherically-seated upper platen and specimen after preparation.\nFig. 4. Three plots generated from fatigue testing of a specimen. A: Force-displacement shown for three cycles as the test progresses; an early cycle, the cycle of\nmaximum sti\ufb00ness (dmax is displacement of this cycle), and the cycle de\ufb01ned as failure (df is displacement of this cycle). B: Strain per cycle was plotted for total strain,\ncreep strain, and damage strain (Haddock et al., 2004). Damage strain was only plotted from the cycle at which sti\ufb00ness was the greatest (Nmax) and began to decline.\nFatigue life, Nf, and strain to failure, \u03b5f, are found from the total strain curve (Bowman et al., 1998).

Pendleton et al.\nBone Reports 9 (2018) 165\u2013172\n168\n2.8. Statistical analysis\nThe means and standard deviations of all outcome measurements\nwere compared between the new method versus the two literature\nmethods. To compare means, a one-way ANOVA was conducted, with a\nTukey-Kramer post-hoc test applied to evaluate signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erences\n(at p \u22640.05). To compare standard deviations, a Bartlett test was\nconducted. Standard deviations were considered signi\ufb01cantly di\ufb00erent\nwith a F-ratio > 1.0 and p \u22640.05. Also, linear regression was used to\ncompare the relationships between maximum cyclic loading force and\nlog of fatigue life (equivalent to a traditional S-N fatigue curve) be-\ntween the three methods. All statistics were performed using JMP\n(v13.0, SAS Institute).\n3. Results\nOf all three methods tested, the new (KFEA) method produced the\nlowest variation in fatigue life. The mean value of the applied force was\nthe same for all groups (22 N), but the standard deviation was lowest\nfor the new (KFEA) method ( \u00b1 0.77 N), 8-fold and 7-fold lower than the\nKEXP and FMAX methods (F-ratio = 5.5; p < 0.01; Fig. 5A), respectively.\nBecause of these larger variations in applied force for the literature\nmethods, the fatigue life displayed a negative S-N type relation with the\nloading force (R2 = 0.73 both literature methods) but there was no such\ncorrelation for the new method (R2 = 0.07; Fig. 6). Instead, for the new\nmethod the fatigue life was approximately uniform across all specimens\n(5.0 \u00b1 0.2), and its standard deviation was 5-fold and 2-fold lower\nthan for the KEXP or FMAX methods, respectively (F-ratio = 4.9;\np = 0.008; Fig. 5A).\nThe new method also provided other measurements related to bone\nquality, both of which displayed high uniformity across the specimens:\nthe e\ufb00ective tissue elastic modulus, Etissue, was 5.83 \u00b1 0.22 GPa and\nthe strain to (cyclic) failure, \u03b5f, was 3.20 \u00b1 0.80%.\nThree additional observations were noteworthy. First, compared to\nthe new method, the average fatigue life was lower for the KEXP method\nby 40.9% (p = 0.002) whereas fatigue life did not di\ufb00er for the FMAX\nmethod (p > 0.90; Fig. 5A). Second, the elastic sti\ufb00ness measured from\nfatigue testing (Kelastic) was also lower for the KEXP method than the\nFMAX method by 42.1% (p = 0.002), and than the new method by\n44.8% (p < 0.001); sti\ufb00nesses for the FMAX and new methods were not\ndi\ufb00erent (p > 0.80; Fig. 5B). And third, the standard deviation for\nsti\ufb00ness was lowest for the new method (F-ratio = 4.53; p = 0.011;\nFig. 5B) compared to the KEXP and FMAX method. The di\ufb00erence in\nsti\ufb00ness variation between FMAX and the new method, which both used\nthe spherically-seated platen, shows that large variations in sti\ufb00ness can\nstill exist even with the use of a pivotable \ufb01xture, presumably due to\nvariable degrees of machine compliance.\n4. Discussion\nOur new method for cyclic loading of small-animal vertebrae\nyielded highly reproducible measurements of fatigue life and was suc-\ncessful, in part, by e\ufb00ectively controlling for the nominal level of strain\napplied to these tiny bone specimens. Failure of bone in both static and\nfatigue loading is largely thought to be strain-controlled (Nalla et al.,\n2003; Bowman et al., 1998; Keaveny et al., 2001; Keaveny et al., 1994c;\nSchileo et al., 2008). To apply a repeatable initial strain to each spe-\ncimen, a consistent measurement of sti\ufb00ness must \ufb01rst be obtained. Our\nnew method utilized specimen-speci\ufb01c micro-CT-based \ufb01nite element\nanalyses to measure specimen sti\ufb00ness and prescribe an individualized\ncyclic force for each specimen. In turn, these individualized forces re-\nsulted in a consistent starting level of strain applied to all test speci-\nmens, and resulted in similar values of fatigue life. By contrast, our\nimplementations of the two literature methods were unable to con-\nsistently apply the speci\ufb01ed starting strain value, which produced more\nscatter in the magnitude of the applied forces and an unintended S-N-\nlike relationship. The reduced level of scatter in fatigue life using this\nmethod would be particularly helpful for studies limited to a small\nsample size, such as in vivo animal experiments, to improve detection\nin cyclic properties.\nThe consistency of our strain-to-failure results with those from other\nstudies supports the validity of our new approach. While the fatigue life\nwill depend on the level of loading, strain-to-failure is emerging as a\nmore uniform outcome across many di\ufb00erent cyclic loading experi-\nments. Our strain-to-failure (mean \u00b1 SD) value of 3.20 \u00b1 0.80%,\nfrom cyclic compression testing of mouse vertebrae, is consistent with\nFig. 5. A: Specimen-speci\ufb01c cyclic loading force and\nnumber of cycles to failure, or fatigue life for each\nmethod. Error bars represent standard deviations.\nStandard deviation of the cyclic loading force was\nsigni\ufb01cantly lower for the KFEA method compared to\nboth other methods (p < 0.01). Standard deviation\nof the fatigue life was signi\ufb01cantly lower for the KFEA\nmethod\ncompared\nto\nboth\nother\nmethods\n(p < 0.01). The mean value for cyclic loading force\nwas the same for all methods. The mean value for\ncycles to failure for FMAX and KFEA were the same,\nhowever cycles to failure for KEXP was lower com-\npared to these methods (p < 0.01).

Pendleton et al.\nBone Reports 9 (2018) 165\u2013172\n169\ncyclic compression results for other species: 3.36 \u00b1 2.13% for human\ntrabecular bone (Haddock et al., 2004), 2.85% \u00b1 0.66% for bovine\ntrabecular bone (Bowman et al., 1998), and 4.19 \u00b1 1.52% for rat\nwhole-bone vertebra (Brouwers et al., 2009). A similar value in cyclic\ncompressive strain-to-failure between these studies and ours might be\nexpected for two reasons. First, the bone material, primarily the col-\nlagen component which dominates the plasticity and therefore strain-\nto-failure of the bone (Burstein et al., 1975), is similar amongst the\nspecies listed. And second, others have reported on relatively uniform\nvalues for the strain-to-failure independent of apparent density, applied\nloads, or temperature (Bowman et al., 1998; Keaveny et al., 2001;\nKeaveny et al., 1994c). While the absolute value of strain to failure will\nbe in\ufb02uenced by any machine compliance, the general level of agree-\nment and small degree of scatter suggests that bone tissue does indeed\nfail at a narrow range of strain under cyclic loading, and that our\nprotocol was successful in reducing the variation in strain across dif-\nferent specimens.\nOur \ufb01ndings also indicate that implementing a pivotable loading\nplaten to ensure uniform contact is important for accuracy of results, at\nleast for these small-animal bones. We observed a reduced Kelastic and\nfatigue life for the KEXP method compared to the new method, even\nthough the specimens used in both protocols had similar size and mi-\ncroarchitecture (Appendix B; Table 1). We attribute these inconsistent\nresults to the rigid platen design used in the KEXP method testing. Even\nwith rigorous specimen preparation in place, we found that perfectly\nplano-parallel loading surfaces on small bones cannot always be\nachieved. And without an adjustable platen, the load can be localized to\nan area that comes into contact with the platen \ufb01rst, producing an ef-\nfective stress concentration. This localized load can result in reduced\nsti\ufb00ness and the stress concentration in reduced fatigue life.\nThere are some limitations to this study. First, the bone tissue used\nin this study was shared tissue, which did not allow for random as-\nsignment of animals across all groups, and thus it is possible specimens\ndi\ufb00ered across groups. However, the similarity in size and structure of\nspecimen across all groups as per micro-CT analysis (Appendix B;\nTable 1) suggests the only source of appreciable heterogeneity could be\nin tissue material properties, which is unlikely because the animals\nwere of the same strain, sex, and approximate age. Second, the initial\nstrain values of (\u03b5max = 0.5%) used for our new method may be speci\ufb01c\nto this particular protocol, which assumed an e\ufb00ective tissue modulus\nof 10 GPa in the \ufb01nite element analyses. The assumed value was chosen\nempirically by trial and error on some preliminary test specimens, such\nthat the resulting Fmax values were approximately half of the directly\nmeasured ultimate force. To use this method in other animal models,\nlarge or small (e.g. rat, bovine, monkey), similar preliminary testing to\ndetermine the value of \u03b5max is suggested, particularly if it is suspected\nthat the e\ufb00ective tissue modulus might di\ufb00er from mouse vertebrae. We\nrecommend using an elastic strain level that is associated with about\nhalf of the ultimate strength. Third, the values of the e\ufb00ective tissue\nelastic modulus reported here are speci\ufb01c to this experiment. Para-\nmeters such as temperature, loading frequency, and use of di\ufb00erent\nplatens, can all contribute to machine compliance and variation be-\ntween tests, thus the e\ufb00ective tissue modulus should not be considered\na true material property. Placing an extensometer across the platens\ndirectly beside the specimen ends can minimize machine compliance\ne\ufb00ects. However, it is best to use the e\ufb00ective tissue modulus as a\nrelative measurement to compare between untreated and treated spe-\ncimens within an experiment, but not across studies (e.g. between\nmouse and rat bones). Lastly, as with any laboratory-based biomecha-\nnical testing, the loading con\ufb01guration does not mimic exact in vivo\nconditions. Our removal of the endplate and loading via a rigid platen\nversus loading via intact disc and endplate is a clear limitation. Thus,\nwhile our results do not describe expected in vivo behavior, our pro-\ntocol does produce highly repeatable results, which should help eluci-\ndate changes in bone quality characteristics by aging, disease, or\ntreatment.\nThe main application of our new method is to provide greater sta-\ntistical power in using small-animal experiments to mechanically assess\nrelevant aspects of bone quality associated with aging, disease, or\ntreatment. A small sample size and scatter associated with the fatigue\ntesting present challenges for detecting statistically signi\ufb01cant e\ufb00ects\nunless those e\ufb00ects are large. For example, Brouwers et al. (Brouwers\net al., 2009) found a 37.5% di\ufb00erence in steady-state creep rate and\n15.7% di\ufb00erence in loss of sti\ufb00ness with zoledronate treatment in an\nosteoporotic rat model, but could not report a detectable signi\ufb01cance\ndue to high variation in the data and loss of some samples. Our KEXP\nmethod was similar to their method, which produced standard devia-\ntions in fatigue life (reported as \u201ctime-to-failure\u201d) up to the same\nmagnitude as the mean value. Our new method should reduce that\nrange up to 8-fold. Furthermore, unlike in the Brouwers literature\nprotocol, we had no loss of specimens, enabled by repeatable specimen\npreparation (e.g. 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel\nsurfaces) and uniform loading of specimen surfaces (e.g. spherically-\nseated platen), which further improves statistical power, and can be\nimplemented for monotonic testing or fatigue testing of small-animal\nvertebrae. That said, our new method is a time intensive process for\nspecimen preparation, micro-CT, image processing, and \ufb01nite element\nanalysis. However, the extra e\ufb00ort improves the ability to detect small\ndi\ufb00erences across treatment groups without using a large number of\nanimals, which is advantageous both ethically and also logistically\nwhen sample sizes are inherently limited (e.g. space \ufb02ight experi-\nments). Thus, use of our new method may improve the ability of future\nstudies to elucidate mechanically relevant aspects of bone quality as-\nsociated with aging, disease, or treatment.\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at https://\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.bonr.2018.10.002.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by a NASA Science and Technology\nResearch Fellowship (NSTRF) NNX14AM56H to MMP, and guidance\nfrom NSTRF research collaborator, Dr. Jean D.

Image processing\nImage processing of the original micro-CT images was conducted prior to \ufb01nite element analysis for each specimen. First, the image stack was\nreoriented to align the specimen with the z-axis (DataViewer v1.5.2.4, Bruker). Second, the reoriented images were thresholded using the \u2018Default\u2019\nAutothreshold algorithm in ImageJ (ImageJ 1.51h, Java 1.6.0_24). The \ufb01nal stack was used to build the \ufb01nite element model.\nA.1. Finite element analysis\nTo determine the computational sti\ufb00ness, high-resolution linear \ufb01nite element analysis was performed. Each 10-\u03bcm cubic voxel in the images was\nM.M. Pendleton et al.\nBone Reports 9 (2018) 165\u2013172\n170\nconverted into an eight-noded brick element to create a \ufb01nite element model of the entire vertebral body. All bone elements were assigned the same\nelastic, homogeneous and isotropic material properties: elastic modulus 10 GPa and Poisson's ratio of 0.3. These values are based on experimental\ntesting of core samples of trabecular bone from human vertebrae (Bevill and Keaveny, 2009). A varied modulus based on tissue mineral density and\nthus micro-CT greyscale was not used in this methodology due to underestimation of apparent modulus using this approach (Kaynia et al., 2015).\nEach model was uniaxially compressed to 2% apparent strain, the input was displacement which varied depending on specimen height. Typical\nmodels contained approximately 1.5 million elements and were solved using a highly scalable, implicit parallel \ufb01nite-element framework Olympus\n(Adams et al., 2004) running on a Dell Linux Cluster supercomputer (Stampede, Texas Advanced Computing Center). The outcome was the whole-\nbone reaction force, which was then used to calculate computational sti\ufb00ness, KFEA (Eq. 4), by dividing by the input displacement.\n=\nK\nReaction force\nInput displacement\nFEA\n(4)\nAppendix B\nTable 1\nThe KEXP and KFEA method specimen structural parameters indicate there were no signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erences in specimen size and shape. There were\nalso no signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erences in the mean or standard deviations (F-ratio = 1.65; p = 0.20) of computed cyclic force between these two groups.\nThe computed cyclic loading force for KEXP group was retrospectively found to demonstrate the di\ufb00erence in standard deviation of cyclic loading\nforce computed with the KEXP method compared to KFEA method (F-ratio = 10.9; p < 0.01). The structural parameters from specimens of the FMAX\nmethod are not compared to KEXP and FMAX method groups because of a di\ufb00erence in resolution of these micro-CT scans (20.7 \u03bcm). However, the\nsti\ufb00ness and fatigue life measurements are the same for the FMAX and KFEA methods, which suggest the structural parameters for the FMAX method\nspecimens were similar to those used in the KEXP and KFEA methods.\nMeasure\nKEXP (n = 6)\nKFEA (n = 5)\np\nMin tissue area (mm2)\n0.97 \u00b1 0.19\n0.96 \u00b1 0.09\n0.92\nAvg tissue area (mm2)\n1.71 \u00b1 0.33\n1.59 \u00b1 0.11\n0.47\nBV/TV (%)\n34.0 \u00b1 1.00\n33.0 \u00b1 1.00\n0.08\nTb.BV/TV (%)\n22.0 \u00b1 3.00\n23.0 \u00b1 1.00\n0.83\nTb.N (1/mm)\n4.94 \u00b1 0.42\n5.30 \u00b1 0.32\n0.15\nTb.Th (\u03bcm)\n47.1 \u00b1 3.26\n44.5 \u00b1 2.58\n0.19\nTb.Sp (\u03bcm)\n198 \u00b1 17.8\n185 \u00b1 14.1\n0.24\nComputed cyclic loading force (N)\n20.9 \u00b1 1.54\n21.2 \u00b1 0.78\n0.73\nCyclic loading force (N)\n22.5 \u00b1 6.78\n21.2 \u00b1 0.78\n0.68\nMean \u00b1 SD\nTable 2\nStructural parameters and resulting forces and fatigue life for L4 and L5 vertebrae used in testing the \u201cFMAX method\u201d.
